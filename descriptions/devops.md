## CI/CD for Infrastructure 
 
This session is a technical deep-dive on CI/CD in practice for Infrastructure. We will walkthrough infrastructure as code options, deployments vs configuration management processes, additional risks and responsibilities for automating the foundational layer of your Azure workloads and more. 
 

## Infrastructure as Code 

In this session we will discuss how to create an ARM Template using Bicep and deploy using Azure Pipelines. We will cover key areas such as CI/CD Pipelines and Authoring Tools. 

## DevSecOps 

In this 200-level session we will walk you through the practice of DevSecOps. You will learn why it is important to apply a "shift-left" security strategy to your software development lifecycle. You will also learn where to apply which security in your CI/CD stages.

Agenda: (1) How to shift your security focus left. (2) Steps in your development process where security can be built in. (3) Tools that can help you in improving your overall security.

Audience: This session is most useful for application architects wanting to improve their overall security stance, as well as security officers wanting insights in how development processes can be secured from the initial conception of a project all the way to production. This session is also useful for developers wanting to build in security on their developer processes. Some knowledge on overall DevOps practices and automation is nice to have.
