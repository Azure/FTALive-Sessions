## App Service Networking 
 
In this session you will learn about the different ways you can secure Azure App Service from a networking perspective. The main focus of the session will be Azure App Service, but you will also be able to apply a lot of the concepts we cover to other Azure PaaS services.  
 
## PaaS Networking 
 
In this session you will learn about the different options available to more closely integrate Platform as a Service into your virtual network, where that requirement exists. The main focus will be the different options available at a high level - the concepts are widely shared between different services. 

## Cloud Architecture 
 
The way we design solutions in the cloud has a large impact on things like scalability, cost, performance, security and managing overhead. In this session, we will discuss how to make informed architecture decisions during the design and requirements phase - not just the "how" but also the "why". Understanding these topics will help you be more successful in the cloud and have a better experience once you are in production. 

## Microsoft Identity Platform 
 
In this session you will learn about the different offerings available in the Microsoft Identity Platform to help you integrate your solutions with a modern cloud-scale identity platform. We will discuss Azure AD (for both single-tenant and multi-tenant apps), Azure AD B2B for guest user access and Azure AD B2C for Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM). We will also cover how they are similar, where they are different, and when to choose which.

These sessions are no longer offered.

### Application Lift and Shift 
 
A "lift and shift" approach offers a quick migration path to the cloud. While this is a valid approach, it is also important to understand the trade-offs of migrating applications with minimal code changes, which can also introduce new complexities in infrastructure as well as increased costs in the short term. In this session, we will discuss the pros and cons of lift and shift, as well as recommended best practices for long-term successful applications in the cloud.
