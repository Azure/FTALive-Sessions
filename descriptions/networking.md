## Azure Networking Part 1 
This is Part One in a Two-Part Series. There are several critical design areas surrounding networking and connectivity to, from, and within Microsoft Azure. You will need to make networking design decisions to properly support the workloads and services that will be hosted in the cloud. The goal of this series is to provide you with an understanding of Azure's core networking services, how they interact with one another, and their respective best practices to aid with your deployments. 
 
## Azure Networking Part 2 
This is Part Two in our Azure Networking Series. In this session we will cover more advanced topics such as Routing, Security and Management of your Networking services. Attendance at Part One is not mandatory but is recommended before joining this second instalment.
