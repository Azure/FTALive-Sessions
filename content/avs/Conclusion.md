# AVS Internet Connectivity Portal Change

If you're using Scenario 1-5, you must choose **"Do not connect or connect using default route from Azure**. This step will need to be done after you have deployed your Azure Network and after you have deployed AVS.

# Alternative AVS Internet Breakout Options

### Enable Managed SNAT for Azure VMware Solution workloads
Azure VMware Solutionâ€™s Managed Source NAT (SNAT) to connect to the Internet outbound. A SNAT service translates from RFC1918 space to the public Internet for simple outbound Internet access. The SNAT service won't work when you have a default route from Azure.

With this capability, you:

- Have a basic SNAT service with outbound Internet connectivity from your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
- Have no control of outbound SNAT rules.
- Are unable to view connection logs.
- Have a limit of 128 000 concurrent connections.

### Enable Public IP to the NSX-T Data Center Edge for Azure VMware Solution
This option brings an allocated Azure Public IPv4 address directly to the NSX-T Data Center Edge for consumption. It allows the Azure VMware Solution private cloud to directly consume and apply public network addresses in NSX-T Data Center as required.

The architecture shows Internet access to and from your Azure VMware Solution private cloud using a Public IP directly to the NSX-T Data Center Edge.

With this capability, you:

- Outbound SNAT
- Inbound DNAT
- Load balancing using VMware NSX Advanced Load Balancer and other third-party Network Virtual Appliances
- Applications directly connected to a workload VM interface.
