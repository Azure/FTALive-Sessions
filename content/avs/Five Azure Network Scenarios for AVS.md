# What are your AVS inspection requirements?


The following table uses VMware solution traffic inspection requirements to provide recommendations and considerations for the most common networking scenarios.

| Scenario | Traffic inspection requirements | Recommended solution design | Considerations |
|---|----|---|---|
| 1 |  - Internet ingress <br> - Internet egress | Use a Virtual WAN secured hub with default gateway propagation. </br></br> For HTTP/S traffic, use Azure Application Gateway. For non-HTTP/S traffic, use Azure Firewall.</br></br> Deploy a secured Virtual WAN hub and enable public IP in Azure VMware Solution. | This solution doesn't work for on-premises filtering. Global Reach bypasses Virtual WAN hubs. |
| 2 |  - Internet ingress <br> - Internet egress <br> - To on-premises datacenter <br> - To Azure Virtual Network| Use third-party firewall NVA solutions in your hub virtual network with Azure Route Server. </br></br> Disable Global Reach. </br></br> For HTTP/S traffic, use Azure Application Gateway. For non-HTTP/S traffic, use a third-party firewall NVA on Azure.| Choose this option if you want to use your existing NVA and centralize all traffic inspection in your hub virtual network. |
| 3 | - Internet ingress <br> - Internet egress <br> - To on-premises datacenter <br> - To Azure Virtual Network <br> Within Azure VMware Solution <br>|   Use NSX-T or a third-party NVA firewall in Azure VMware Solution. </br></br>  Use Application Gateway for HTTPs, or Azure Firewall for non-HTTPs traffic. </br></br> Deploy the secured Virtual WAN hub and enable public IP in Azure VMware Solution.| Choose this option if you need to inspect traffic from two or more Azure VMware Solution private clouds. </br></br> This option lets you use NSX-T native features. You can also combine this option with NVAs running on Azure VMware Solution between L1 and L0. |
| 4 | - Internet ingress <br> - To Azure Virtual Network| Use Virtual WAN secured hub. </br></br>  For HTTP/S traffic, use Azure Application Gateway. For non-HTTP/S traffic, use Azure Firewall.</br></br> Deploy a secured Virtual WAN hub and enable public IP in Azure VMware Solution. | Choose this option to advertise the `0.0.0.0/0` route from on-premises datacenters. |
| 5 | - Internet ingress <br> - Internet egress </br> - To on-premises datacenter </br> - To Azure Virtual Network   | </br>  Use third-party firewall solutions in a hub virtual network with Azure Route Server. </br></br> For HTTP/S traffic, use Azure Application Gateway. For non-HTTP/S traffic, use a third-party firewall NVA on Azure. </br></br> Use an on-premises third-party firewall NVA. </br></br> Deploy third-party firewall solutions in a hub virtual network with Azure Route Server. | Choose this option to advertise the `0.0.0.0/0` route from an NVA in your Azure hub virtual network to an Azure VMware Solution.|
