## Overview

In this FTA Live session the FastTrack Azure VMware Solution team will cover the 5 established architecture patterns that have been developed to support common customer scenarios. We will start with a review of the networks and firewalls and how ExpressRoute, ExpressRoute Global Reach, VPN and network peering are used to meet specific customer requirements. This session is designed to help technical sellers understand the 5 scenarios and how to match customers to the appropriate architecture, and for engineers, an opportunity to deep dive into the connectivity and routing patterns.
