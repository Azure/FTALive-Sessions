#### [home](./readme.md) | [prev](./readme.md) | [next](./migration-options.md)

- Azure Cloud Services (classic) will be retiring on August 31, 2024. Prior to that date you'll need to migrate your services that were deployed using this model to Cloud Services (extended support) in Azure Resource Manager.
- **After 31 August 2024**, classic Cloud Services will no longer be supported and the **applications running on them will no longer be available**.

## Benefits of Upgrading
- Cloud Services (extended support) provides the following new capabilities:
    - Support for deployment templates 
    - Role-based access control 
    - Regional resiliency
