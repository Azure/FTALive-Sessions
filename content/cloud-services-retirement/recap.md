# Recap classic Cloud Services to Cloud Services Extended Support

#### [home](./readme.md) | [prev](./post-deployment-changes.md)

**After 31 August 2024**, classic Cloud Services will no longer be supported and the **applications running on them will no longer be available**.

Two options have been made available to assist you in migrating your classic Cloud Services to Cloud Services Extended Support.

1. An automation migration feature
1. Redeploy your services to a new Cloud Services Extended Support instance

Regardless of which approach you choose make sure that you have migrated all of your applications from your classic Cloud Services to Cloud Services Extended Support by August 31, 2024.
