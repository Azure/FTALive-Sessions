# What we see in the field at Fast Track for Azure

When working with customers, we often see the following:

- Customers who want to leverage Private Endpoints for security purposes, enable them, but find that they do not operate without additional configuration.
- Customers who want to access Azure resources over their private network from their on-prem locations, but do not have a plan for managing DNS resolution from on-prem.
- Customers who want to use Private Endpoint for inbound traffic to the services, but don't have a plan for how other services will interact, or how those same services will handle outbound traffic.

These are all scenarios that can be addressed, but being forewarned about how to adopt Private Endpoints for a workload can save a lot of effort.
