# Why use Private Endpoints?

Private Endpoints can be used for the following scenarios:

- Keeping workload traffic within your private network.
- Having an assigned public IP for accessing the service, instead of having to use the variable of a service endpoint.
- Access from your on-prem network to an Azure service via private networking (With a VPN or ExpressRoute Gateway)
- Standardizing management to NSGs and ASGs, instead of via service specific firewalls.
