# Security and Routing with Private Endpoints

## Securing Private Endpoints

- Secure like VM NICs
- Follow core network isolation practices
- Use NSGs and ASGs to restrict access to resources on the same Spoke Vnet
- Use Firewalls and other appliances to secure between on-prem-to-spoke and spoke-to-spoke scenarios.
