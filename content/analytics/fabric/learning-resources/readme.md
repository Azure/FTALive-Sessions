# Microsoft Fabric Learning Resources (Last Updated 14th August 2023)

The goal of this page is to provide a curated list of resources to learn about Microsoft Fabric. Note that this list is not exhaustive. </br>


### Live Sessions
* The first resource to share is an upcoming Fabric roadshow hosted in Auckland, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne at the end of August.
Registration link: https://forms.microsoft.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR4ynbCkNbytGob-QlNa-j_xUNjRMM0ZSTUQzU0ZGVllUMVdHNUJNSk9EQi4u

* There are several live virtual sessions coming up which you can find here: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/
Just search for “Fabric”.
 
### Getting Started
* Introduction: https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-the-end-to-end-scenarios-in-microsoft-fabric
* Video Introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6A3jtvB62U (and link to pdf version of the deck [here](https://publicstoragejs.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/Microsoft%20Fabric%20-%20James%20Serra%20-%20Public.pdf).
* Official MS Learning Path: Get started with Microsoft Fabric: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/get-started-fabric/
* Hands on tutorials: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/end-to-end-tutorials
 

It’s important to understand the major features of Fabric (and changes compared to Synapse and other services). Specifically:
* OneLake: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-overview
* Delta Parquet: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/lakehouse-and-delta-tables AND  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/delta-optimization-and-v-order?tabs=sparksql
* Compute Units (CUs): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/enterprise/licenses AND https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/spark-job-concurrency-and-queueing
* Capacity Bursting and Smoothing: (Watch this space)
* Lakehouse: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/lakehouse-overview
* Warehouse: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/data-warehousing
* Lakehouse vs Warehouse: https://youtu.be/cmQ9hs8DdR0, https://youtu.be/7bd7aG0s3uQ AND https://youtu.be/34sI2e30JUM
* Data Engineering (Spark): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/data-engineering-overview
* Power Bi Direct Lake: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/directlake-overview
* Power BI Git integration: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-git
* Security: (Watch this space)
 
These links are introductory and a good place to start. You can obviously dig much deeper on each topic. 
 
If you consume the above, you’ll have a great understanding of the capabilities of MS Fabric in its current Preview state!
Note that there is an ongoing trial period with MS Fabric. See: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial </br>
Once that trial is over, the cheapest capacity is F2 which provides full Fabric functionality (except sharing PBI workspaces), is relatively affordable and can be stopped/started. 
 
### Documentation
Microsoft documentation gets updated incrementally and in batches in-line with product releases. Please expect regular updates ramping up towards the end of the calendar year.
