## Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions (AMS)

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you'll want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation.

Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions is an Azure-native monitoring product for anyone running their SAP landscapes on Azure. It works with both [SAP on Azure Virtual Machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-get-started) and [SAP on HANA Large Instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-overview-architecture).

With AMS, you can collect telemetry data from Azure infrastructure and databases in one central location and visually correlate the data for faster troubleshooting.

You can monitor different components of an SAP landscape, such as Azure virtual machines (VMs), high-availability cluster, SAP HANA database, SAP NetWeaver, and so on, by adding the corresponding [provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/azure-monitor-providers) for that component. For more information, see [Deploy Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions by using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/azure-monitor-sap-quickstart).

Supported infrastructure:

- Azure virtual machine
- HANA Large Instance

Supported databases:

- SAP HANA
- Microsoft SQL server

AMS uses the [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview) capabilities of [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) and [Workbooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview).
