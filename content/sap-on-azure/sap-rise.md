# Welcome to FTA Live session "Connect and Integrate RISE with SAP Landscapes to Azure"

## Agenda

In this session you will learn about Azure network connectivity options and how to connect SAP-managed RISE with SAP landscapes into your own Azure virtual networks.

We will also present a sample integration scenario for sending e-mails from SAP NetWeaver through Exchange Online, independent of your deployment choice on Azure, native SAP on Azure or RISE with SAP.
