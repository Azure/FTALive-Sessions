# Why Should I Upgrade to ASE v3?

#### [home](./readme.md) | [prev](./readme.md) | [next](./migration-options.md)

- Azure Cloud Services (classic) will be retiring on August 31, 2024. As App Service Environment version 1 and version 2 run on Azure Cloud Services (classic), we will retire App Service Environment version 1 and version 2 on the same date.
- **After 31 August 2024**, App Service Environment version 1 and version 2 will no longer be supported and these App Service Environments and the **applications running on them will no longer be available**.

## Benefits of Upgrading
- App Service Environment version 3 has the ability to run across Availability Zones in regions where zones are available. This enables higher availability and more resilient applications.
- App Service Environment version 3 runs on newer and more performant Virtual Machine Scale Sets infrastructure 
- Apps in internal VIP App Service Environment version 3 can be reached across global peering 
- Price savings due to elimination of Stamp Fee and access to use reserved instance pricing
