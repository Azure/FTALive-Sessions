#### [home](./readme.md) | [prev](./redeploy.md)

App Service Environment version 1 and version 2 will be retired on August 31, 2024. **After August 31, 2024**, App Service Environment version 1 and version 2 will no longer be supported and these App Service Environments and the **applications running on them will no longer be available**.

An automated migration tool has been provided that can migrate most ASE v1 / v2 environments to ASE v3.

If your ASE v1 / v2 cannot be migrated to ASE v3 via the automated migration tool, you can choose to migrate use one of the following options.

- App Service Backup and Restore
- Cloning Your App
- Manually create and redeploy your app

Regardless of which approach you choose make sure that you have migrated all of your applications from your ASE v1 / v2 services to ASE v3 by August 31, 2024.
