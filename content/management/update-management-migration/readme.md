# Azure Update Manager - Migrating from Update Management

## Overview

Update Manager is a unified service to help manage and govern updates for all your machines. You can monitor Windows and Linux update compliance across your deployments in Azure, on-premises, and on other cloud platforms from a single dashboard. You can also use Update Manager to make real-time updates or schedule them within a defined maintenance window.

In this session, learn how to plan and approach your migration from the legacy Update Management solution to Azure Update Manager, as well as how to use Azure Update Manager to view update compliance, deploy critical updates and use flexible patching options.
