- [Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/) - Estimate cost savings of moving to Azure from on-premises.

### Reporting Tools

- [Cost Management & Billing](https://aka.ms/costanalysis) - Track resource usage and analyze cost of your cloud services.
- Use a [Tagging strategy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/allocate-costs#view-cost-allocation-for-tags) that supports your cost reporting needs.
- Consider [tag inheritance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/enable-tag-inheritance) to allocate costs across different groups.
- Split shared costs using [cost allocation rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/allocate-costs).
