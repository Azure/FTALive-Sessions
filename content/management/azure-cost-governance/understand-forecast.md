# Understand & Forecast Costs

#### [prev](./overview.md) | [home](./readme.md)  | [next](./optimize.md)

Understanding and forecasting costs is an essential part of cost management. Azure provides several tools to help you estimate, track, and analyze the costs of your cloud services. In this section, we will explore some of these tools.

### Forecast Tools (*Before Deployment*)

- [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) - This tool allows you to forecast your costs before deployment by providing you with an estimated monthly cost based on your expected usage. You can input a wide range of variables such as number of VMs, storage requirements, and bandwidth usage to get a detailed estimate of your costs.
- [Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/) -  If you are considering moving to Azure from an on-premises environment, this tool can help you estimate the cost savings of making the switch. By inputting data about your current infrastructure, such as the number of servers and storage capacity, the TCO Calculator will give you a detailed estimate of your current costs and how much you could save by moving to Azure.

### Reporting Tools (*After Deployment*)

- [Cost Management & Billing](https://aka.ms/costanalysis) - This tool provides you with visibility into your cloud spend and allows you to analyze the cost of your cloud services. It provides detailed reports on usage and cost broken down by service, subscription, and resource group. You can also use the tool to set budgets and alerts to help you stay within your budget. 
  - [Anomaly Alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/analyze-unexpected-charges#create-an-anomaly-alert) - Create alerts to automatically get notified when an anomaly is detected in your Azure costs. An anomaly alert email includes a summary of changes in cost, top changes for the day compared to the previous 60 days, and a direct link to the Azure portal for further investigation.
- Use a [Tagging strategy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/allocate-costs#view-cost-allocation-for-tags) that supports your cost reporting needs. By applying tags to your resources, you can create detailed reports that show how your cloud resources are being used and identify areas where you can optimize costs. 
- Consider [tag inheritance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/enable-tag-inheritance) to allocate costs across different groups. Tag inheritance allows you to apply tags to resource groups and automatically apply those tags to the resources within those groups. This helps to ensure that your cost reporting is accurate and allows you to identify costs at a granular level.
- Split shared costs using [cost allocation rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/allocate-costs). If you have resources that are shared between different departments or teams, you can use cost allocation rules to allocate the costs of those resources based on usage. This allows you to distribute costs fairly and accurately across different departments or teams.
