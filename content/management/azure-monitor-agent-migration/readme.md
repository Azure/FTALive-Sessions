## Overview
In this session, learn how to plan and approach your migration from the legacy Microsoft Monitoring Agent/OMS Agent to the Azure Monitor Agent, where used with Azure Monitor and other services.

## Agenda

* Migration Approach
* Additional Considerations
* Tools to use

## Session Summary

When planning the migration, it is important to understand your current environment, and your monitoring strategy. If you do not currently have a well defined monitoring strategy, this is a good time to revisit this.

### Migration approach
* **Understand your agents**
    * How many agents do you have to migrate?
    * Do you have agents residing outside of Azure?
        * You will need to deploy the Azure Arc agent to these servers first
    * Are you using System Center Operations Manager (SCOM)?
        * Start evaluating SCOM Managed Instance
    * How are you deploying agents today?


* **Understand your workspaces**
    * Are all your workspaces in use?
    * Is now a good time to do a cleanup?


* **Understand your data collections**
    * Are you using any legacy solutions for data collection?
    * Do you have any data collections configured in the workspace(s)?
        * Use the DCR generator tool to create Data Collection Rules from your current data collections


* **Understand additional dependencies**
    * Are you using any of the following:
        * Update Management
            * Start evaluating Update Management Center
        * Change Tracking and Inventory
            * Start evaluating the new Change Tracking and Inventory solution
        * Defender for Cloud?
            * Change your agent deployments in Defender for Cloud to the AMA-based or agentless scanning approach, depending on your needs
        * Microsoft Sentinel?
            * Change to the AMA-based data collections in Sentinel
