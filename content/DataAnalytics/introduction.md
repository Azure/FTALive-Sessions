# Introduction
Data today is available in various forms and can be stored in various relational and non-relational engines. It becomes vital how the type of data, storage or data, security, governance, access and networking play an important role in creating an end-to-end DataAnalytics Pipeline. The key stakeholders here in identifying and designing data sources and flow of data are Data Engineers and Data Analysts

## Target Audience
Data analysts are responsible for profiling, cleaning, and transforming data.
Their responsibilities also include designing and building scalable and effective data models, and enabling and implementing the advanced analytics capabilities into reports for analysis.

Data engineers provision and set up data platform technologies that are on-premises and in the cloud. They manage and secure the flow of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources. The data platforms that they use can include relational databases, nonrelational databases, data streams, and file stores. Data engineers also ensure that data services securely and seamlessly integrate across data platforms.Primary responsibilities of data engineers include the use of on-premises and cloud data services and tools to ingest, egress, and transform data from multiple sources.

## What is this session about

* **Who:** This session is meant for Data Engineers & Data Analysts. As a data analyst, you would work closely with a data engineer in making sure that you can access the variety of structured and unstructured data sources because they will support you in optimizing data models, which are typically served from a modern data warehouse or data lake. Data analysts work with data engineers to determine and locate appropriate data sources that meet stakeholder requirements.

* **What**: The session is a walk-through of different types of data, how they can be stored, what operations are performed on data and how to go about deciding on the model/ heirarchy /structure & operations on data

* **When**: We conduct these sessions regularly based on customer demand. 

* **Where**: These sessions are offered as part of 'FTA Live' and delivered virtually. To learn when this session will next be delivered and for a full catalogue of FTA Live sessions please visit [aka.ms/ftalive](https://aka.ms/ftalive).

* **Why**: Did you know when to go for OLTP and when to go for OLAP engines ? Or what is the basic difference between a Data Warehouse/ Data Lakehouse and Delta Lake ? This session aims to cut through the noise and provide you with the latest advice and engineering opinions on every aspect of DataAnalytics pipleines.
