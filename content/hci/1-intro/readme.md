# Azure Stack HCI - Part 1: Introduction To HCI

## Agenda
Azure Stack HCI is a new hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) operating system delivered as an Azure service. 
This is our solution in cases where latency, data sovereignity or legal restrictions require you to stay onpremise. Run your favorite workloads like virtual machines, kubernetes and bring Azure services like SQL managed instances, Azure Virtual Desktop meeting the requirements of onpremise hosting.
It provides the latest security, performance, and hybrid capabilities, which now include Azure Arc enablement and new management scenarios through the Azure portal. 

However, there are a lot of moving parts and decision points to get AzStack HCI running.
