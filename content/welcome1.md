## What is FastTrack for Azure Live?

FTA Live is a series of multi-customer live sessions delivered by FastTrack for Azure Program Managers and Engineers in an interactive format, enabling direct engagement and an informal forum for demos and questions to be answered.

## Ground rules

> **Open forum**
>
> This is an informal discussion forum for multiple customers - please don't share any confidential information here. This is also why we don't record these sessions, as we want this to be a safe space.

> **Stay on topic**
>
> Any question on today's topic or more broadly related to Azure is fair game. If we can't answer everything in this session then please attend our regular FTA Live Q&A sessions!

> **Use Teams features**
>
> We suggest using the "raise your hand" button to help the presenter and moderators get to you efficiently. The chat window will also be monitored so feel free to ask your questions there at any time (note that questions you post will be visible to all attendees).

> **Save before leaving**
>
> You likely only have access to the chat window during the session, please open or copy any links you want to keep before leaving!
