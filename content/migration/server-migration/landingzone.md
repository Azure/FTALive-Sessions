## Review an Azure Landing Zone

An existing landing zone can be reviewed using the [Azure Review Checklists](https://github.com/Azure/review-checklists). The Review Checklists help facilitate design reviews to help track improvements and recommendations across a variety of checklists including landing zones, Azure Virtual Desktop, security, and more. The latest spreadsheet can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/Azure/review-checklists/releases/latest/download/review_checklist.xlsm).
