# What is an Azure AD B2C Tenant?

#### [home](./readme.md) | [prev](./azure-ad-b2c-capabilities.md) | [next](./azure-ad-b2c-resources.md)

- An Azure AD B2C tenant is a directory that stores external users that interact with your organization
- Each B2C tenant is distinct and separate from other Azure AD B2C tenants
- A B2C tenant is different than an Azure AD tenant
- For production scenarios we recommend a single Azure AD B2C tenant as this will allow single sign-on across applications for your consumers
