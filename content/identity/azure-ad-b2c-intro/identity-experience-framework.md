# Identity Experience Framework

#### [home](./readme.md) | [prev](./api-connectors.md)

The Identity Experience Framework is a powerful identity engine with a comprehensive feature set primarily used to build custom policies.

## Custom Policies

Allow you to build complex, custom user journeys that cannot be created using built-in user flows.

## User Flows versus Custom Policies

| User Flows | Custom Policies |
|------------|-----------------|
| Targeted at all application developers | Targeted at identity pros comfortable with OpendID Connect flows, identity providers, and claims-based authentication|
| Built with a user-friendly user interface provided in the Azure portal | Directly edit XML files and upload to the portal |
| Limited integration with external systems via API Connectors | Fully integrate with external systems via APIs |
