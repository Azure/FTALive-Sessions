## Single sign-on access with a user provided identity

![Single Sign-On](./Media/single-sign-on.png)

- Uses standards-based authentication protocols such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML
- Integrates with most modern applications and off-the-shelf software
- Serves as a central authentication and authorization authority for all your apps
- Enables you to build a single sign-on solution for all of them

## Integrate with external user stores

![External User Stores](./Media/external-user-stores.png)

- Provides a directory that can hold 100 custom attributes per user
- Can also integrate with external systems
- Have Azure AD B2C handle the authentication for your application, but integrate with an external system that stores user profile or personal data
- Facilitate collecting the information from the user during registration or profile editing, then hand that data off to the external system via API
- During future authentications, Azure AD B2C can retrieve the data from the external system and, if needed, include it as a part of the authentication token response it sends to your application

## Custom-branded identity solution
