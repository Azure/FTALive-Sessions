## Azure Data Factory CI/CD

## <img src="images/cicd-adf.png" alt="ADF CI/CD" style="float: left; margin-right:10px;" />

Azure Data Factory easily integrates with both GitHub and Azure DevOps Git to enable source control, release management and CI/CD. With source control, developers can collaborate, track, and save their changes to a branch of choice.   

In this session we will describe how to implement continuous integration and continuous deployment for Azure Data Factory. We will dive deeper into the advantages of integrating your Azure Data Factory with GitHub or Azure DevOps, discuss any known limitations and best practices and walk you through typical CI/CD workflows as well as more advanced scenarios. 

It will be delivered by Microsoft FastTrack for Azure engineers. Bring your questions!
