## Azure MLOps: Deploying and Managing AI Models

## <img src="images/azuremlops.png" alt="Azure MLOps" style="float: left; margin-right:10px;" />

MLOps—machine learning operations, or DevOps for machine learning—enables data science and IT teams to collaborate and increase the pace of model development and deployment via monitoring, validation, and governance of machine learning models.   

Once a model is created, we need to deploy it, we need to ensure the performance does not decay, and we need to keep track of the current model in production. In this FTA-Live Session we will cover the best practices to deploy, manage, and retrain machine learning models within Azure. We will discover how to deploy machine learning models up to production and discover how to leverage the built-in integration with Azure DevOps for seamless scheduling, managing, and automating workflows.  We’ll also look at the five best practices to optimize your MLOps lifecycle on Azure: 
  1. Creating models with reusable ML Pipelines
  2. Automating your MLOPs rollout 
  3. Automatically creating an audit trail 
  4. Deploying and monitoring performance 
  5. Observing data drift. 
  
Finally, you'll learn about what MLOps capabilities to consider within Azure and the underlying nuances needed to create a robust pipeline that deploys, manages, and retrains machine learning models with ease.

It will be delivered by Microsoft FastTrack for Azure engineers. Bring your questions!
