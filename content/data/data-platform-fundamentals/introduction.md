# Introduction

Data is available in various forms and can be stored in various relational and non-relational engines. Data types, storage methods, security, governance, access and networking all play an important role in creating an end-to-end Data Analytics Pipeline. The key stakeholders involved with identifying and designing data sources and flow of data are Data Engineers and Data Analysts.

## Target Audience

**Data Analysts** are responsible for profiling, cleaning, and transforming data. Their responsibilities also include designing and building scalable and effective data models, and enabling and implementing the advanced analytics capabilities into reports for analysis.

**Data Engineers** provision and configure data platform infrastructure (both on-premises and in the cloud). The data platforms that they use can include relational databases, non-relational databases, data streams, and file stores. They manage and secure the flow of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources. Ensuring seamless integration across these platforms, Data Engineers primarily focus on using on-premises and cloud data services and tools to efficiently extract, ingest, and transform data from diverse sources.

## What is this session about

* **Who:** This session is meant for Data Engineers & Data Analysts. As a Data Analyst, you would work closely with a Data Engineer to ensure you can access the variety of structured and unstructured data sources relevant to optimizing data models. These data sources are are typically served from a modern data warehouse or a data lake. Data Analysts work with tools provisioned by Data Engineers, to discover and locate appropriate data sources that meet stakeholder requirements.

* **What**: The session is a walk-through of different types of data, how they can be stored, what operations are performed on data, how to go about deciding on the model,hierarchy, structure, and operations that can be completed on data.

* **When**: We conduct these sessions regularly based on customer demand. 

* **Where**: These sessions are offered as part of FastTrack for Azure Live (FTA Live) and are delivered virtually. To learn when this session will next be delivered and for a full catalogue of FTA Live sessions please visit [aka.ms/ftalive](https://aka.ms/ftalive).

* **Why**: Do you know the difference between OLTP and OLAP, their strengths, and how to choose between them? Or what is the difference between a Data Warehouse, Data Lakehouse and Delta Lake? This session aims to cut through the noise and provide you with advice and guidance for implementing Azure Data Services.
