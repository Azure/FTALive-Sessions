# Welcome to FastTrack for Azure Live - Data Analytics

Data today is available in various forms and can be stored in various relational and non-relational engines. It becomes vital how the type of data, storage or data, security, governance, access and networking play an important role in creating an end-to-end DataAnalytics Pipeline. The key stakeholders here in identifying and designing data sources and flow of data are Data Engineers and Data Analysts. This is an intended session for such folks to help make better and efficient design decisions when it comes to data pipelines.
