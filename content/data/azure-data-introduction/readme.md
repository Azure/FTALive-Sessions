# Welcome to FastTrack for Azure Live - Introduction to Azure Data Fundamentals

Data today is available in various forms and can be stored in various relational and non-relational engines. Data types, storage methods, security, governance, access and networking all play an important role in creating an end-to-end Data Analytics Pipeline. The key stakeholders involved with identifying and designing data sources and flow of data are Data Engineers and Data Analysts. This session is intended to help guide and improve the design decisions made when implementing data pipelines.

**Agenda**

There is a lot that goes in to creating, validating and implementing an end-to-end Data Analytics Pipeline. As such, this content is designed to be _delivered_ in two to three parts. Below is the agenda, however we intentionally will not be covering all of the content. Instead we encourage you to access this repository at your own pace.
