Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen 1 is being replaced by Gen 2. The end of life for Gen 1 is Feb 2024 ([Retirement Announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/action-required-switch-to-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2-by-29-february-2024/). 
We are running a Program, the *ADLS Gen1 to Gen2 Migration Initiative*, with the Customer Support Unit (CSU), FastTrack for Azure Team and Azure Storage Product Group to ensure our customer base can successfully migrate from ADLS Gen 1 to ADLS Gen 2 in the timeframe noted above. 
This 1.5-hour session will provide you the opportunity to expand on your knowledge of how to migrate, and how to complete a migration as efficiently and accurately as possible.

It will be delivered by Microsoft FastTrack for Azure engineers. Bring your questions!
