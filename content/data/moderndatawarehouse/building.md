## Scenario based
* Don't attempt to 'boil the ocean' by building the entire MDW in one go! Instead, define business scenarios that need to be addressed, and work through them in order.

## Infrastrcture as Code (IaC)
* Just do it

## DataOps
* Just do this too
* !!Link to Brad's Synapse blog series!!

## Metadata driven
* Avoid hardcoding
* Reduce number of pipelines by using parametisation.
* Plan for failure
