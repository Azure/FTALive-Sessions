## Scenario based
* Don't attempt to 'boil the ocean' by building the entire MDW in one go! Instead, define business scenarios that need to be addressed, and work through them in order
* Start with *modern* requirements rather than rebuilding like-for-like
* Provide value to the business 'fast'
* Make sure you have knowledge and the skills within the team to achieve the scenario

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* What is it
* Source Control
* Why should you do it

## DataOps
* Strongly recommend doing it
* Source Control
* Why: Code driven, automated
* Bringing existing methodologies to the cloud, won't make the most of it.
* Secret to getting the most out of the cloud
* !!Link to Brad's Synapse blog series!!

## Metadata driven
* Avoid hard coding
* Reduce number of pipelines by using parametrisation.
