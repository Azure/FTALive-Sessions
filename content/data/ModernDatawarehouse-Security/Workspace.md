## Workspace and Least Privilege user


### Least Privilege user

[<Back](https://github.com/LiliamLeme/FTALive-Sessions_Synapse_SQL/blob/main/content/data/ModernDatawarehouse-Security/Network.md)\- [Next >](https://github.com/LiliamLeme/FTALive-Sessions_Synapse_SQL/blob/main/content/data/ModernDatawarehouse-Security/Dedicated%20SQL%20Pool.md)

#### Workspace permissions

Azure Synapse Workspace is integrated with Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to manage its resources. Azure RBAC allows you to manage Azure resource access through role assignments. You can assign these roles to users, groups service principals, and **managed identities**. Use built-in roles to allocate permissions and only create custom roles when required.

Azure Synapse Analytics requires users in Azure Owner or Azure Contributor roles at the resource-group to control management of its dedicated SQL pools, Spark pools, and Integration runtimes. In addition to this, users and the workspace system-identity must be granted Storage Blob Data Contributor access to the ADLS Gen2 storage container associated with the Synapse workspace.

#### Manage application identities securely and automatically

Azure Synapse Workspace supports managed identities for its Azure resources. Use managed identities with Azure Synapse Workspace instead of creating service principals to access other resources. Azure Synapse Workspace can natively authenticate to the Azure services/resources that supports Azure AD authentication through a pre-defined access grant rule without using credentials hard coded in source code or configuration files.

### What are Managed identities?

·    **System-assigned**. Some Azure services allow you to enable a managed identity directly on a service instance. When you enable a system-assigned managed identity, an identity is created in Azure AD. The identity is tied to the lifecycle of that service instance.

·    **User-assigned**. You may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. You can [create a user-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal) and assign it to one or more instances of an Azure service. For user-assigned managed identities, the identity is managed separately from the resources that use it.

### Security RBAC

#### Access Synapse Studio

You can open Synapse Studio and view details of the workspace and list any of its Azure resources such as SQL pools, Spark pools, or Integration runtimes. You will see if you've been assigned any Synapse RBAC role or have the Azure Owner, Contributor, or Reader role on the workspace.

### Resource management

You can create SQL pools, Data Explorer pools, Apache Spark pools, and Integration runtimes if you're an Azure Owner or Contributor on the workspace. When using ARM templates for automated deployment, you need to be an Azure Contributor on the resource group.

You can pause or scale a dedicated SQL pool, configure a Spark pool, or an integration runtime if you're an Azure Owner or Contributor on the workspace or that resource.

#### Access Control

Suggestion: You can create a basic group and add your members at the same time using the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) portal and add permissions as applied,  you will use the following [Access control in Synapse workspace how to - Azure Synapse Analytics | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/security/how-to-set-up-access-control) and [How to manage groups - Azure Active Directory - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups):

- **Security Groups**, to group users with similar access requirements.
- **Azure roles**, to control who can create and manage SQL pools, Apache Spark pools and Integration runtimes, and access ADLS Gen2 storage.
- **Synapse roles**, to control access to published code artifacts, use of Apache Spark compute resources and integration runtimes.
- **SQL permissions**, to control administrative and data plane access to SQL pools.
- **Git permissions**, to control who can access code artifacts in source control if you configure Git-support for workspaces.

### View and edit code artifacts

With access to Synapse Studio, you can create new code artifacts, such as SQL scripts, KQL scripts, notebooks, spark jobs, linked services, pipelines, dataflows, triggers, and credentials. These artifacts can be published or saved with additional permissions.

If you're a Synapse Artifact User, Synapse Artifact Publisher, Synapse Contributor, or Synapse Administrator you can list, open, and edit already published code artifacts.

### Execute your code

You can execute SQL scripts on SQL pools if you have the necessary SQL permissions defined in the SQL pools. You can execute KQL scripts on Data Explorer pools if you have the necessary permissions.

You can run notebooks and Spark jobs if you have Synapse Compute Operator permissions on the workspace or specific Apache Spark pools.

With Compute Operator permissions on the workspace or specific integration runtimes, and appropriate credential permissions you can execute pipelines.

### Monitor and manage execution

You can review the status of running notebooks and jobs in Apache Spark pools if you're a Synapse User.

You can review logs and cancel running jobs and pipelines if you're a Synapse Compute Operator at the workspace or for a specific Spark pool or pipeline.

### Debug pipelines

You can review and make changes in pipelines as a Synapse User, but if you want to be able to debug it you also need to have Synapse Credential User.

### Publish and save your code

You can publish new or updated code artifacts to the service if you're a Synapse Artifact Publisher, Synapse Contributor, or Synapse Administrator.

You can commit code artifacts to a working branch of a Git repository if the workspace is Git-enabled and you have Git permissions. With Git enabled, publishing is only allowed from the collaboration branch.

If you close Synapse Studio without publishing or committing changes to code artifacts, then those changes will be lost.

## Tasks and required roles

The table below lists common tasks and for each task, the Synapse RBAC, or Azure RBAC roles required.

 Note

Synapse Administrator is not listed for each task unless it is the only role that provides the necessary permission. A Synapse Administrator can perform all tasks enabled by other Synapse RBAC roles.

 Note

Guest users from another tenant are also able to review, add, or change role assignments once they have been assigned as Synapse Administrator.


#### Synapse role-based access control
Azure Synapse also includes Synapse role-based access control (RBAC) roles to manage different aspects of Synapse Studio. Leverage these built-in roles to assign permissions to users, groups, or other security principals to manage who can:

        Publish code artifacts and list or access published code artifacts.
        Execute code on Apache Spark pools and integration runtimes.
        Access linked (data) services that are protected by credentials.
        Monitor or cancel job executions, review job output and execution logs.


The minimum Synapse RBAC role required is shown.

All Synapse RBAC roles at any scope provide you Synapse User permissions at the workspace.

All Synapse RBAC permissions/actions shown in the table are prefixed `Microsoft/Synapse/workspaces/...`.
