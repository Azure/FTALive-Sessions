#### Workspace - Connection

Connection Security refers to how you restrict and secure connections to your database using firewall rules and connection encryption. you can use the portal page under network to configure the IPs that can access the workspace:

With managed Vnet:

Dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) are encrypted by default. Modifying connection settings to disable encryption are ignored.

#### Public network access
You can use the public network access feature to allow incoming public network connectivity to your Azure Synapse workspace.

        When public network access is disabled, you can connect to your workspace only using private endpoints.
        When public network access is enabled, you can connect to your workspace also from public networks. You can manage this feature both during and after your workspace creation.
  
Note:
This feature is only available to Azure Synapse workspaces associated with Azure Synapse Analytics Managed Virtual Network. However, you can still open your Synapse workspaces to the public network regardless of its association with managed VNet.
        
####  Minimal TLS version

Starting in December 2021, a requirement for TLS 1.2 has been implemented for workspace-managed dedicated SQL pools in new Synapse workspaces. Login attempts from connections using a TLS version lower than 1.2 will fail. 

####  Connection policy
**Default**:  The default policy is Redirect for all client connections originating inside of Azure (for example, from an Azure Virtual Machine) and Proxy for all client connections originating outside (for example, connections from your local workstation).
We highly recommend the Redirect connection policy over the Proxy connection policy for the lowest latency and highest throughput.

**Redirect**
If you are connecting from within Azure your connections have a connection policy of Redirect by default. A policy of Redirect means that after the TCP session is established to Azure SQL Database, the client session is then redirected to the right database cluster with a change to the destination virtual IP from that of the Azure SQL Database gateway to that of the cluster. Thereafter, all subsequent packets flow directly to the cluster, bypassing the Azure SQL Database gateway. The following diagram illustrates this traffic flow.

**Proxy**
If you are connecting from outside Azure, your connections have a connection policy of Proxy by default. A policy of Proxy means that the TCP session is established via the Azure SQL Database gateway and all subsequent packets flow via the gateway.

#### Manage VNet
 
When you create your Azure Synapse workspace, you can choose to associate it to a Microsoft Azure Virtual Network. The Virtual Network associated with your workspace is managed by Azure Synapse. This Virtual Network is called a *Managed workspace Virtual Network*. Creating a workspace with a Managed workspace Virtual Network associated with it ensures that your workspace is network isolated from other workspaces. 

If your workspace has a Managed workspace Virtual Network, Data integration and Spark resources are deployed in it. A Managed workspace Virtual Network also provides user-level isolation for Spark activities because each Spark cluster is in its own subnet.

Dedicated SQL pool and serverless SQL pool are multi-tenant capabilities and therefore reside outside of the Managed workspace Virtual Network. Intra-workspace communication to dedicated SQL pool and serverless SQL pool use Azure private links. These private links are automatically created for you when you create a workspace with a Managed workspace Virtual Network associated to it.

Private endpoints can be accessed from only within the same virtual network and from other virtual networks that are globally or regionally peered to the VNET that contains these private endpoints and from customer on prem network using express route or VPN gateway

Private endpoints are mapped to an instance of PaaS resource instead of the entire service. In the event of a security incident within a network, only mapped resource instance is exposed, minimizing the exposure and data leakage from other instances


#### Connecting to the Storage


Azure storage provides a layered security model that enables you to secure and control access to your storage accounts. You can configure IP firewall rules to grant traffic from selected public IP address ranges access to your storage account. You can also configure network rules to grant traffic from selected virtual networks access to your storage account.

If you enabled **Managed virtual network** when you created the workspace, then your workspace is associated with a dedicated virtual network managed by Azure Synapse. These virtual networks are not created in your customer subscription. Therefore, you will not be able to grant traffic from these virtual networks access to your secured storage account using network rules. Analytic capabilities such as **Dedicated SQL pool and Serverless SQL pool use multi-tenant infrastructure that is not deployed into the managed virtual network**. In order for traffic from these capabilities to access the secured storage account, you must configure access to your storage account based on the workspace's system-assigned managed identity

#### Data Extra filtration (DEP)

Azure Synapse Analytics workspaces support enabling data exfiltration protection for workspaces. With exfiltration protection, you can guard against malicious insiders accessing your Azure resources and exfiltrating sensitive data to locations outside of your organizationâ€™s scope. At the time of workspace creation, you can choose to configure the workspace with a managed virtual network and additional protection against data exfiltration. Workspaces with data exfiltration protection, resources within the managed virtual network always communicate over [managed private endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/security/synapse-workspace-managed-private-endpoints) and the Synapse SQL resources can only connect to authorized Azure resources (targets of approved managed private endpoint connections from the workspace). The main ideas is to prevent malicious users with high permission such as Contributor RBAC role from using SQL or Spark pools to write data out to remote servers, Azure-based or not.

**Limitations:**

Users can provide an environment configuration file to install Python packages from public repositories like PyPI. In data exfiltration protected workspaces, connections to outbound repositories are blocked. 

 DEP enables you to limit connections from Synapse Pipelines to a service in specified Azure AD Tenants connecting through managed private endpoints, when using the Azure Integration Runtime.
 
When using the Azure Integration Runtime with DEP enabled, Linked Service connection (that is to say connections to other services) must occur through managed private endpoints. The services which are supported within Azure Synapse Analytics managed private endpoints (at the time of) are:

         Azure Storage (including Blob, Data Lake Storage Gen 2, Queue, Table and File)
         Azure SQL Database
         Azure SQL Managed Instance (in preview)
         Azure Cosmos DB (SQL and Mongo API)
         Azure Key Vault
         Azure Search
         Azure Database for PostgreSQL
         Azure Database for MariaDB
         Azure Database for MySQL
         Azure Functions
         Azure Cognitive Services
