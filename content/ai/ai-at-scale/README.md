## AI at Scale

### Overview
Breakthroughs in machine learning techniques, machine learning tools, and computing resources in the cloud are enabling a new class of AI models like large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. In this session, we will introduce the concepts of the foundation models like LLMs and provide an overview of Azure AI services, including Azure Machine Learning and Azure OpenAI Service.
