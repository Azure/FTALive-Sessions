SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Border Hospital Survival and Illegal Immigrant Care Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) Immigration is a Federal responsibility. (2) The Immigration and Naturalization Service does not take into custody all aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States. (3) Section 1867 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395dd) and State laws require that, if any individual (whether or not lawfully present in the United States) comes to a hospital and the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide either, within the staff and facilities available at the hospital, for such further medical examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition, or, if appropriate, for transfer of the individual to another medical facility. (4) The Southwest border region is ill-equipped to absorb the expense of providing health care to undocumented aliens because it ranks last in the country in terms of per capita income. (5) The Southwest border region has been designated as a health professional shortage area under section 332 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e). (6) The unreimbursed costs associated with caring for undocumented aliens are severely threatening the financial stability of health care providers in Arizona. SEC. 3. REIMBURSEMENT TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE RENDERED TO CERTAIN ALIENS. Section 322 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 249) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(d)(1) The Secretary shall establish and implement a 5-year pilot program under which funds made available under paragraph (6) are used to reimburse providers for items and services described in section 411(b)(1) of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1621(b)(1)) provided in Arizona to aliens described in paragraph (3), and to reimburse suppliers of emergency ambulance services furnished to such aliens for which the transportation originates in Arizona (where the use of other methods of transportation is contraindicated by the alien's condition), if payment may not be made to reimburse the provider or supplier under any Federal program or law other than this subsection (such as title XIX of the Social Security Act), any State or local program or law, any group or individual health plan, or any insurance policy. ``(2) As part of the pilot program, in a case in which an alien described in paragraph (3) arrived at a hospital in Arizona and the hospital provided for such medical examination and treatment of the alien as the hospital determined was required to stabilize an emergency medical condition (within the meaning of section 1867(e)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395dd(e)(1))), the Secretary shall use funds made available under paragraph (6) to reimburse the hospital for any transportation costs paid by the hospital to return the alien to the United States border, if-- ``(A) the hospital requested the Attorney General to take the alien into custody after such stabilization; ``(B) such request was denied within 24 hours after its receipt, or the Attorney General gave no response to it within such period; and ``(C) the hospital determined that discharging the alien without providing for such transportation might pose a threat to the health or safety of the alien (or, with respect to a pregnant alien, the health or safety of the alien or her unborn child). ``(3) An alien is described in this paragraph if the alien-- ``(A) is not lawfully present in the United States and not detained by any Federal, State, or local law enforcement authority; or ``(B) is paroled into the United States under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) for less than one year in order to receive treatment for an emergency medical condition. ``(4) During the period in which the pilot program is operating, the Secretary shall submit annual reports to the Congress on its operation. Each report shall contain at least the following information: ``(A) The number of aliens to whom assistance was rendered for which payment was made under this subsection during the previous year. ``(B) The nationality of such aliens. ``(C) The average cost per alien of such assistance. ``(D) The total annual amount paid to each provider or supplier of assistance. ``(E) The feasibility and estimated cost of expanding the pilot program to items and services provided anywhere in the Southwest border region of the United States. ``(5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize any reduction in the funds payable to any person under any Federal program or law other than this subsection (such as title XIX of the Social Security Act), any State or local program or law, any group or individual health plan, or any insurance policy. ``(6) To the extent provided in appropriations Acts, from amounts made available to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for enforcement and border affairs for each of the 5 fiscal years following the fiscal year in which the Border Hospital Survival and Illegal Immigrant Care Act is enacted, the Attorney General may transfer to the Health Resources and Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services such amounts as may be necessary to carry out this subsection, not to exceed $50,000,000 for each such year.''.

Summary:"," Border Hospital Survival and Illegal Immigrant Care Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a five-year pilot program of health care provider reimbursement for the costs associated with providing emergency medical and ambulance services in Arizona to: (1) illegal aliens who are not detained by any Federal, State, or local law enforcement authority. Or (2) aliens paroled into the United States for less than one year to receive emergency medical treatment. [end] "

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Persian Gulf War Illness Compensation Act of 2001''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Although the majority of veterans of the Armed Forces who served in the Persian Gulf War returned from the Southwest Asia theater of operations to normal activities, many of those veterans have experienced a range of unexplained illnesses, including chronic fatigue, muscle and joint pain, loss of concentration, forgetfulness, headache, and rash. (2) Those veterans were potentially exposed during that war to a wide range of biological and chemical agents, including sand, smoke from oil-well fires, paints, solvents, insecticides, petroleum fuels and their combustion products, organophosphate nerve agents, pyridostigmine bromide, depleted uranium, anthrax and botulinum toxoid vaccinations, and infectious diseases, in addition to other psychological and physiological stresses. (3) Section 1117 of title 38, United States Code, enacted on November 2, 1994, by the Persian Gulf War Veterans' Benefits Act (title I of Public Law 103-446), provides for the payment of compensation to Persian Gulf veterans suffering from a chronic disability resulting from an undiagnosed illness (or combination of undiagnosed illnesses) that became manifest to a compensable degree within a period prescribed by regulation. (4) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs prescribed regulations under section 1117 of title 38, United States Code, that interpreted that section so as to limit compensation to Persian Gulf veterans with illnesses that ``cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis''. (5) In a report dated September 7, 2000, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences indicated that it was not asked to determine whether an identifiable medical syndrome referred to as ``Gulf War Syndrome'' exists and suggested that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in developing a compensation program for Persian Gulf veterans, consider the health effects that may be associated with exposures to specific agents that were present in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War. SEC. 3. COMPENSATION OF VETERANS OF PERSIAN GULF WAR WHO HAVE CERTAIN ILLNESSES. (a) Presumptive Period for Undiagnosed Illnesses Program.--Section 1117 of title 38, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)(2), by striking ``within the presumptive period prescribed under subsection (b)'' and inserting ``before December 31, 2011, or such later date as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation''; and (2) by striking subsection (b). (b) Undiagnosed Illnesses.--Such section, as amended by subsection (a), is further amended by inserting after subsection (a) the following new subsection (b): ``(b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term `undiagnosed illness' means illness manifested by symptoms or signs the cause, etiology, or origin of which cannot be specifically and definitely identified, including poorly defined illnesses such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune disorder, and multiple chemical sensitivity. The attribution of one or more of the symptoms to a disability that is not an undiagnosed illness shall not preclude other symptoms from being considered a manifestation of an undiagnosed illness. ``(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), signs or symptoms that may be a manifestation of an undiagnosed illness include the following: ``(A) Fatigue. ``(B) Unexplained rashes or other dermatological signs or symptoms. ``(C) Headache. ``(D) Muscle pain. ``(E) Joint pain. ``(F) Neurologic signs or symptoms. ``(G) Neuropsychological signs or symptoms. ``(H) Signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or lower). ``(I) Sleep disturbances. ``(J) Gastrointestinal signs or symptoms. ``(K) Cardiovascular signs or symptoms. ``(L) Abnormal weight loss. ``(M) Menstrual disorders.''. (c) Presumption of Service Connection Program.--Section 1118(a) of such title is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph: ``(4) For purposes of this section, the term `undiagnosed illness' has the meaning given that term in section 1117(b) of this title.''. (d) Effective Date.--(1) For purposes of section 5110(g) of title 38, United States Code-- (A) the amendments to section 1117 of title 38, United States Code, made by subsections (a) and (b) shall take effect as of November 2, 1994; and (B) the amendment to section 1118 of title 38, United States Code, made by subsection (c) shall take effect as of October 21, 1998. (2) The second sentence of section 5110(g) of title 38, United States Code, shall not apply in the case of an award, or increased award, of compensation pursuant to the amendments made by this section if the date of application therefor is not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act.

Summary:"," Persian Gulf War Illness Compensation Act of 2001 - Amends a veterans' benefits program of compensation for disabilities occurring in veterans of the Persian Gulf War to: (1) require such disabilities, to be compensable, to occur before December 31, 2011, or such later date as prescribed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. (2) define an undiagnosed illness in such veterans as one manifested by specified symptoms or signs the cause, etiology, or origin of which cannot be specifically and definitely identified. And (3) include an undiagnosed illness having such a symptom or sign within the presumption of being service-connected and therefore treatable as a service-connected disability. [end] "

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Improved Health Care at Lower Cost Act of 2013''. SEC. 2. EXCEPTION AND SAFE HARBOR FROM FEDERAL SANCTIONS FOR INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FROM HOSPITALS TO PHYSICIANS UNDER CERTAIN INCENTIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The Department of Health and Human Services has been engaged in approving, on a project-by-project basis, gain- sharing arrangements under demonstration authority for nearly a decade. Based on the knowledge gained from such demonstration projects, the Department is capable of developing and applying standards for permitting such arrangements more generally without the use of such authority. (2) The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services has issued a special advisory bulletin in July 1999 that indicates that there is no general authority for waiving sanctions for any gain-sharing arrangements between physicians and hospitals. (3) Due to lack of capitalization, size limitations, risk characteristics, and other factors, many hospitals and physicians have been unable or unwilling to enter into gain- sharing types of arrangements that meet the requirements of the shared savings program. (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish general statutory authority within the Department of Health and Human Services to recognize gain-sharing and other incentive payment programs, other than the shared savings program, that align incentives among hospitals and physicians to improve efficiency and decrease costs while maintaining or improving quality care. (c) Exception From Physician Self-Referral Prohibition.--Section 1877(e) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395nn(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph: ``(9) Payments under certain incentive payment programs between hospitals and physicians.-- ``(A) In general.--In the case of a monetary incentive payment which is made by a hospital to a physician under an incentive payment program (as defined in subparagraph (B)) that meets requirements established by the Secretary in consultation with the Attorney General and the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services for purposes of this paragraph. ``(B) Incentive payment program defined.--In this paragraph, the term `incentive payment program' means a program that is designed to align incentives among hospitals and physicians (through techniques such as product standardization, the substitution of lower cost products, and care coordination initiatives that encourage medically appropriate decreases in length of stay) to improve efficiency and decrease costs while maintaining or improving quality.''. (d) Safe Harbor From Antikickback and Other Federal Sanctions.-- (1) Section 1128B(b)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)(3)) is amended-- (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (I); (B) in subparagraph (J), by moving the indentation 2 ems to the left and by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(K) any monetary incentive payment which is made by a hospital to a physician under an incentive payment program (as defined in subparagraph (B) of section 1877(e)(9)) that meets requirements established by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services in consultation with the Attorney General for purposes of applying this subparagraph (which requirements needs not be the same as those established under subparagraph (A) of such section).''. (2) Section 1128A(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a(b)(1)) is amended by inserting ``(other than a monetary incentive payment described in section 1128B(b)(3)(K))'' after ``makes a payment''. (e) Publication of Guidance.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services-- (1) not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, shall jointly publish a solicitation of comments to carry out the amendments made by this section; and (2) not later than 12 months after such date of enactment, shall publish, jointly or separately, such guidance or rules, which may be effective on an interim, final basis, as may be necessary to carry out such amendments in a timely manner. (f) Construction.--Nothing in this section (or the amendments made by this section) shall be construed as affecting the operation of the shared savings program. (g) Shared Savings Program Defined.--In this section, the term ``shared savings program'' means such program under section 1899 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395jjj).

Summary:", Improved Health Care at Lower Cost Act of 2013 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) and XI of the Social Security Act with respect to the prohibition against certain physician referrals. Excepts from the physician self-referral prohibition any monetary incentive payments made by hospitals to physicians under certain incentive payment programs designed to align incentives among hospitals and physicians to improve efficiency and decrease costs while maintaining or improving quality. Exempts such monetary incentive payments from federal criminal antikickback and other sanctions. [end]

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Making Access Records Available to Lead American Government Openness Act'' or the ``MAR-A-LAGO Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Beginning in 2009, the Obama administration instituted a policy to release the visitor access records for the White House complex. (2) This policy was responsible for making public the names of nearly 6,000,000 visitors to the White House in the 8 years of the Obama administration. (3) This policy provided the people of the United States with insight into who influences the White House and transparency regarding efforts by lobbyists to effect policies, legislation, and Presidential actions. (4) To date, the Trump administration has not indicated whether it will continue the policy of publicly releasing White House visitor access records. (5) Since taking office on January 20, 2017, President Trump has conducted official business not only in the White House, but also at several of his privately owned clubs and resorts. (6) President Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, has been dubbed the ``Winter White House'' and the ``Southern White House''. (7) President Trump has spent 5 of his first 9 weekends in office at Mar-a-Lago. (8) Mar-a-Lago is a private membership facility open to members, their guests, and others who have been invited as guests for special events. (9) Visitors to Mar-a-Lago do not undergo the same background checks as White House visitors and visitor access records to the club have not been released to the public. (10) The President has conducted official business and hosted international leaders at Mar-a-Lago. (11) Media reports have shown President Trump and members of his Cabinet at Mar-a-Lago and nearby Trump International Golf Club interacting with members and guests, providing access unavailable to the general public. (12) President Trump owns many other properties that offer similar amenities and membership-only access where he is likely to conduct official business during his term in office. (13) On March 11, 2017, President Trump hosted several members of his Cabinet at his Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, to discuss homeland security, health care, and the economy according to media reports. (14) Media reports have indicated that the President may use his Bedminster, New Jersey, resort as a ``Summer White House''. (15) The people of the United States expect and deserve transparency in government. The policy to release visitor access records instituted by the previous administration appropriately balanced transparency with the need for confidentiality in government actions. (16) To the extent Mar-a-Lago and any other private facilities become locations where the President conducts business and interacts with individuals who are not government officials, the same disclosures should apply. SEC. 3. IMPROVING ACCESS TO INFLUENTIAL VISITOR ACCESS RECORDS. (a) Definitions.--In this section: (1) Covered location.--The term ``covered location'' means-- (A) the White House; (B) the residence of the Vice President; and (C) any other location at which the President or the Vice President regularly conducts official business. (2) Covered records.--The term ``covered records'' means information relating to a visit at a covered location, which shall include-- (A) the name of each visitor at the covered location; (B) the name of each individual with whom each visitor described in subparagraph (A) met at the covered location; and (C) the purpose of the visit. (b) Requirement.--Except as provided in subsection (c), not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the President shall establish, and update every 90 days, a publicly available database that contains covered records for the preceding 90-day period. (c) Exceptions.-- (1) In general.--The President shall not include in the database established under subsection (b) any covered record-- (A) the posting of which would implicate personal privacy or law enforcement concerns or threaten national security; or (B) relating to a purely personal guest at a covered location. (2) Sensitive meetings.--With respect to a particularly sensitive meeting at a covered location, the President shall-- (A) include the number of visitors at the covered location in the database established under subsection (b); and (B) post the applicable covered records in the database established under subsection (b) when the President determines that release of the covered records is no longer sensitive.

Summary:"," Making Access Records Available to Lead American Government Openness Act or the MAR-A-LAGO Act This bill directs the President to establish and update, every 90 days, a publicly available database that contains records of: the name of each visitor at the White House, residence of the Vice-President, or any other location at which the President or Vice President regularly conducts official business. The name of each individual with whom the visitor met at the covered location. And the purpose of the visit. The President shall not include in the database any such record: (1) the posting of which would implicate personal privacy or law enforcement concerns or threaten national security, or (2) relating to a purely personal guest at a covered location. For a particularly sensitive meeting, the President shall: (1) include in the database the number of visitors at the covered location, and (2) post the applicable records in the database when their release is no longer sensitive.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Mercury Reduction and Energy Security Act of 2010''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') was required by the terms of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and a 1998 consent agreement to determine whether regulation of mercury from electric utility steam generating units under section 112 of the Clean Air Act was appropriate and necessary. (2) In a December 2000, regulatory finding, the EPA concluded that regulation of mercury from electric utility steam generating units was appropriate and necessary. (3) In 2005, the EPA withdrew its 2000 regulatory finding in favor of a national cap-and-trade system for mercury emissions from electric utility steam generating units, the Clean Air Mercury Rule (``CAMR''). (4) CAMR was subsequently challenged in petitions for review filed by 17 States. (5) The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the rule on February 8, 2008, finding that once the EPA had listed electric utility steam generating units as a source of hazardous air pollutants, it was required by law to proceed with Maximum Achievable Control Technology (``MACT'') regulations under section 112 of the Clean Air Act unless it delisted the source category, under procedures set forth in section 112(c)(9). (6) Mercury control technologies for coal-fired electric utility steam generating units have advanced rapidly in the last few years. (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect public health and welfare, and the environment, through mercury emission reductions from electric utility steam generating units. SEC. 3. MERCURY EMISSION REDUCTIONS. The Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new title: ``TITLE VII--MERCURY REDUCTIONS ``SEC. 701. DEFINITIONS. ``In this title: ``(1) Affected unit.--The term `affected unit' means a coal-fired electric steam generating unit (including a cogeneration unit) that-- ``(A) has a nameplate capacity greater than 25 megawatts; and ``(B) generates electricity for sale. ``(2) Cogeneration unit.--The term `cogeneration unit' means a stationary, coal-fired boiler or a stationary, coal- fired combustion turbine having equipment used to produce electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of energy that produces during the 12-month period starting on the date the unit first produces electricity and during any calendar year after which the unit first produces electricity-- ``(A) for a topping-cycle cogeneration unit-- ``(i) useful thermal energy not less than 5 percent of total energy output; and ``(ii) useful power that, when added to one-half of useful thermal energy produced, is not less than-- ``(I) 42.5 percent of total energy input if useful thermal energy produced is 15 percent or more of total energy output; or ``(II) 45 percent of total energy input if useful thermal energy produced is less than 15 percent of total energy output; and ``(B) for a bottoming-cycle cogeneration unit, useful power not less than 45 percent of total energy input. ``(3) Inlet mercury.--The term `inlet mercury' means the quantity of mercury found-- ``(A) in the as-fired coal used by an affected unit; or ``(B) for an affected unit using coal that is subjected to an advanced coal cleaning technology, in the as-mined coal used by the affected unit. ``SEC. 702. MERCURY REDUCTION PROGRAM. ``(a) Annual Limitation for Affected Units.--Except as provided in subsection (f), an affected unit in operation before or after the date of enactment of this title shall be subject to the following emission limitations on an annual average calendar year basis with respect to mercury: ``(1) Calendar years 2012 through 2014.--For the period beginning on January 1, 2012, and ending on December 31, 2014, the less stringent limitation of the following (calculated on a one-year rolling average): ``(A) 80 percent capture of inlet mercury. ``(B) An emission rate of 1.60 pounds of mercury per trillion British thermal units of input coal. ``(2) Calendar year 2015 and thereafter.--For calendar year 2015 and each calendar year thereafter, the less stringent limitation of the following (calculated on a one-year rolling average): ``(A) 90 percent capture of inlet mercury. ``(B) An emission rate of 0.80 pounds of mercury per trillion British thermal units of input coal. ``(b) Averaging Across Units Within a Facility or State.--(1) An owner or operator of more than one affected unit at a single facility may demonstrate compliance with the applicable annual average emission limitations under subsection (a) by averaging emissions from all affected units at that facility, weighted by total input coal British thermal units. ``(2) An owner or operator of more than one affected unit or units within a State may demonstrate compliance with the applicable annual average emission limitations under subsection (a) by averaging emissions from all affected units owned or operated by that owner or operator within such State, weighted by total input coal British thermal units, if all affected units are owned or operated by the same entity. ``(3) If an affected unit is owned or operated by more than one entity, the State in which the affected unit is located shall allocate to each such owner or operator an appropriate portion of the generation from the affected unit for purposes of averaging emissions pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2). ``(c) Reference Methods for Measuring Mercury Emissions.--(1) The owner or operator of an affected unit shall use any of the following methods as a reference method to calibrate the instruments used to measure the mercury concentration in emissions from affected units: ``(A) ASTM D6784-02, `Standard Test Method for Elemental, Oxidized, Particle-Bound and Total Mercury in Flue Gas Generated from Coal-Fired Stationary Sources' (Ontario Hydro Method). ``(B) 40 C.F.R.

Such owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator mercury emissions data measured by a CEMS that complies with subsection (d) for evaluation. If the Administrator determines that such owner or operator has properly installed and operated such CEMS and control technology designed to achieve such annual average emission limitation and is unable to meet such limitation, the Administrator may, not later than April 1, 2016, establish an alternate emissions limitation for mercury with respect to such affected unit based on the optimal performance of properly installed and operated control technology. ``(2) With respect to any affected unit, for any year for which an alternate emissions limitation for mercury is in place for such affected unit, the Administrator may review such alternate emissions limitation and impose a more stringent emissions limitation for mercury for the subsequent year based on new data regarding the demonstrated control capabilities of the type of control technology installed and operated at such affected unit. ``(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an owner or operator of an affected unit failing to achieve the annual average emission limitation under subsection (a)(2) that notifies the Administrator of such failure and requests and alternate emissions limitation for mercury pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be considered in compliance with this section (and not subject to any excess emissions penalty) for the period beginning on January 1, 2015, and ending on the date such an alternate emissions limitation is implemented. ``(B) An owner or operator described in subparagraph (A) shall pay an excess emissions penalty, as determined under subsection (e)(2), for the period described in such subparagraph, if such owner or operator operates or maintains the affected unit, including any associated air pollution control equipment, in a manner that is inconsistent with good air pollution control practices for the minimization of mercury emissions, as determined by the Administrator. In determining whether the owner or operator of the affected unit operates and maintains the affected unit in a manner that is consistent with good air pollution control practices for the minimization of mercury emissions, the Administrator may review the emissions monitoring data and operating and maintenance procedures of the affected unit and may inspect the affected unit. ``(4)(A) With respect to any affected unit for which an alternate emissions limitation for mercury is in place under this subsection, the owner or operator of such affected unit that emits mercury in excess of such alternate emissions limitation shall pay an excess emissions penalty determined under subparagraph (B). ``(B) The excess emissions penalty for mercury for an owner or operator of an affected unit described in subparagraph (A) shall be an amount equal to $50,000 for each pound of mercury emitted in excess of the alternate emissions limitation for mercury in place for such affected unit. Such penalty shall be prorated for each fraction of a pound. ``(g) Sole Limitation on Mercury.--This title shall apply the sole emission standard or limitation under this Act with regard to the emission of mercury from electric utility steam generating units and shall supersede any other such requirement under section 112 or any other provision of this Act. ``(h) Relationship to Other Law.--Except as otherwise specifically provided in this title, nothing in this title precludes a State or political subdivision of a State from adopting or enforcing any additional requirements for the control or abatement of mercury emissions, except that no State or political subdivision thereof shall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard relating to the reduction or control of mercury emissions from electric utility steam generating units that is less stringent than the standards provided in this title.''.

Summary:"," Mercury Reduction and Energy Security Act of 2010 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require affected units to reduce mercury emissions by the less stringent limitation of: (1) 80 capture of inlet mercury or an emission rate of 1.6 pounds of mercury per trillion British thermal units (Btu) of input coal for the period beginning on January 1, 2012, and ending December 31, 2014. And (2) 90 capture of inlet mercury or an emission rate of 0.8 pounds of mercury per trillion Btu of input coal by 2015 and each year thereafter. Specifies methods that owners or operators of affected units are required to use as reference methods in calibrating the instruments used to measure the mercury concentrations in emissions from affected units. Establishes excess emissions penalties for mercury. Sets forth compliance provisions. Authorizes: (1) owners or operators of affected units that fail to achieve such limitations to request an alternate emission limitation. (2) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish alternate limitations if the Administrator determines that the owner or operator has properly installed and operated continuous emissions monitoring system and control technology designed to achieve such limitations and is unable to achieve such limitations. And (3) the Administrator, after granting alternate limitations, to impose more stringent emissions limitations in subsequent years. Makes such alternate limitations effective January 1, 2015.

SECTION 1. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. The Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the organization of the militia of the District of Columbia'', approved March 1, 1889 (sec. 49--101 et seq., D.C. Official Code) is amended by adding at the end the following new title: ``TITLE II--EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ``SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. ``(a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the `Major General David F. Wherley, Jr. District of Columbia National Guard Retention and College Access Act'. ``(b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: ``(1) The District of Columbia National Guard is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the President of the United States as Commander-in-Chief and, unlike other National Guards, is permanently federalized. ``(2) The District of Columbia National Guard is unique and differs from the National Guards of the several States in that the District of Columbia National Guard is responsible, not only for residents of the District of Columbia, but also for a special and unique mission and obligation as a result of the extensive presence of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia. ``(3) Consequently, the President of the United States, rather than the chief executive of the District of Columbia, is in command of the District of Columbia National Guard, and only the President can call up the District of Columbia National Guard even for local emergencies. ``(4) The District of Columbia National Guard has been specifically trained to address the unique emergencies that may occur regarding the presence of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia. ``(5) The great majority of the members of the District of Columbia National Guard actually live in Maryland or Virginia, rather than in the District of Columbia. ``(6) The District of Columbia National Guard has been experiencing a disproportionate decline in force in comparison to the National Guards of Maryland and Virginia. ``(7) The States of Maryland and Virginia provide additional recruiting and retention incentives, such as educational benefits, in order to maintain their force, and their National Guards have drawn recruits from the District of Columbia at a rate that puts at risk the maintenance of the necessary force levels for the District of Columbia National Guard. ``(8) Funds for an educational benefit for members of the District of Columbia National Guard would provide an incentive to help reverse the loss of members to nearby National Guards and allow for maintenance and increase of necessary District of Columbia National Guard personnel. ``(9) The loss of members of the District of Columbia National Guard could adversely affect the readiness of the District of Columbia National Guard to respond in the event of a terrorist attack on the capital of the United States. ``SEC. 202. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ``(a) Educational Assistance Program Authorized.--The Mayor of the District of Columbia, in coordination with the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, shall establish a program under which the Mayor may provide financial assistance to an eligible member of the District of Columbia National Guard to assist the member in covering expenses incurred by the member while enrolled in an approved institution of higher education to pursue the member's first undergraduate, masters, vocational, or technical degree or certification. ``(b) Eligibility.-- ``(1) Criteria.--A member of the District of Columbia National Guard is eligible to receive assistance under the program established under this title if the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard certifies to the Mayor the following: ``(A) The member has satisfactorily completed required initial active duty service. ``(B) The member has executed a written agreement to serve in the District of Columbia National Guard for a period of not less than 6 years. ``(C) The member is not receiving a Reserve Officer Training Corps scholarship. ``(2) Maintenance of eligibility.--To continue to be eligible for financial assistance under the program, a member of the District of Columbia National Guard must-- ``(A) be satisfactorily performing duty in the District of Columbia National Guard in accordance with regulations of the National Guard (as certified to the Mayor by the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard); ``(B) be enrolled on a full-time or part-time basis (seeking to earn at least 3, but less than 12 credit hours per semester) in an approved institution of higher education; and ``(C) maintain satisfactory progress in the course of study the member is pursuing, determined in accordance with section 484(c) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1091(c)). ``SEC. 203.

If the Mayor determines that the amount available to provide assistance under this title in any year will be insufficient, the Mayor may reduce the maximum amount of the assistance authorized, or set a limit on the number of participants, to ensure that amounts expended do not exceed available amounts. ``(c) Relation to Other Assistance.--Except as provided in section 202(b)(1)(C), a member of the District of Columbia National Guard may receive financial assistance under the program in addition to educational assistance provided under any other provision of law. ``(d) Repayment.--A member of the District of Columbia National Guard who receives assistance under the program and who, voluntarily or because of misconduct, fails to serve for the period covered by the agreement required by section 202(b)(1) or fails to comply with the eligibility conditions specified in section 202(b)(2) shall be subject to the repayment provisions of section 373 of title 37, United States Code. ``SEC. 204. ADMINISTRATION AND FUNDING OF PROGRAM. ``(a) Administration.--The Mayor, in coordination with the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard and in consultation with approved institutions of higher education, shall develop policies and procedures for the administration of the program under this title. Nothing in this title shall be construed to require an institution of higher education to alter the institution's admissions policies or standards in any manner to enable a member of the District of Columbia National Guard to enroll in the institution. ``(b) Funding Sources and Gifts.-- ``(1) Authorization of appropriations.--There are authorized to be appropriated to the District of Columbia such sums as may be necessary to enable the Mayor to provide financial assistance under the program. Funds appropriated pursuant to this authorization of appropriations shall remain available until expended. ``(2) Transfer of funds.--The Mayor may accept the transfer of funds from Federal agencies and use any funds so transferred for purposes of providing assistance under the program.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Home Health Beneficiary Equity and Payment Simplification Act of 1999''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Research has shown that medicare beneficiaries who are in need of home health services that are covered under the medicare program generally fall into 1 of the 4 following categories: (A) Post-hospital, short-stay beneficiaries. (B) Medically stable, long-stay beneficiaries. (C) Medically complex, long-stay beneficiaries. (D) Medically unstable and complex, extremely high- use beneficiaries. (2) The interim payment system for home health services under the medicare program, enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and amended by title V of the Tax and Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998 (contained in Division J of Public Law 105-277), is having the following unintended consequences: (A) The sickest, most frail medicare beneficiaries are losing access to medically necessary home health services that are otherwise covered under the medicare program. (B) Many high quality, cost-effective home health agencies have had per beneficiary limits under the interim payment system set so low that such agencies are finding it impossible to continue to provide home health services under the medicare program. (C) Many home health agencies are being subjected to aggregate per beneficiary limits under the interim payment system that do not accurately reflect the current patient mix of such agencies, thereby making it impossible for such agencies to compete with similarly situated home health agencies. (D) Medicare beneficiaries that reside in certain States and regions of the country have far less access to home health services under the medicare program than individuals who have identical medical conditions but reside in other States or regions of the country. (E) The health status of home health beneficiaries varies significantly in different regions of the country, creating differing needs for home health services. SEC. 3. PAYMENTS TO HOME HEALTH AGENCIES UNDER MEDICARE. (a) Revision of Prospective Payment System.-- (1) In general.--Section 1895 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395fff) (as amended by section 5101 of the Tax and Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998 (contained in Division J of Public Law 105-277)) is amended-- (A) in subsection (a), by striking ``for portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after October 1, 2000'' and inserting ``for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1999''; and (B) in subsection (b), by striking the last sentence of paragraph (1) and all that follows and inserting the following: ``(2) Payment basis.-- ``(A) In general.--The prospective payment amount to be paid to a home health agency under this section for all of the home health services (including medical supplies) provided to a beneficiary under this title during the 12-month period beginning on the date that such services are first provided by such agency to such beneficiary pursuant to a plan for furnishing such services (and for each subsequent 12-month period that services are provided under such plan) shall be an amount equal to the applicable amount specified in subparagraph (B) for the fiscal year in which the 12- month period begins. ``(B) Applicable amount.--Subject to subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) and paragraph (5), for purposes of this subsection, the applicable amount is equal to-- ``(i) $2,603 for a beneficiary described in subparagraphs (A) and (E) of paragraph (3); ``(ii) $3,335 for a beneficiary described in paragraph (3)(B); ``(iii) $4,228 for a beneficiary described in paragraph (3)(C); and ``(iv) $21,864 for a beneficiary described in paragraph (3)(D). ``(C) Annual update.-- ``(i) In general.--The applicable amount specified in subparagraph (B) shall be adjusted for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2001) in a prospective manner specified by the Secretary by the home health market basket percentage increase applicable to the fiscal year involved. ``(ii) Home health market basket percentage increase.--For purposes of clause (i), the term `home health market basket percentage increase' means, with respect to a fiscal year, a percentage (estimated by the Secretary before the beginning of the fiscal year) determined and applied with respect to the mix of goods and services included in home health services in the same manner as the market basket percentage increase under section 1886(b)(3)(B)(iii) is determined and applied to the mix of goods and services comprising inpatient hospital services for the fiscal year. ``(D) Area wage adjustment.-- ``(i) In general.--The portion of the applicable amount specified in subparagraph (B) (as updated under subparagraph (C)) that the Secretary estimates to be attributable to wages and wage-related costs shall be adjusted for geographic differences in such costs by an area wage adjustment factor for the area in which the home health agency is located. ``(ii) Establishment of area wage adjustment factors.--The Secretary shall establish area wage adjustment factors that reflect the relative level of wages and wage- related costs applicable to the furnishing of home health services in a geographic area compared to the national average applicable level.

Only 13 percent of young adults aged 18 through 24 in the United States were able to correctly identify Iraq on a map of Asia and the Middle East. ``(3) The economic stature and competitiveness of the United States requires increasingly sophisticated levels of geographic knowledge and mastery of geographic tools. ``(4) United States Department of Labor data identifies geotechnology as one of the 3 fastest growing employment fields serving industries such as insurance, banking, real estate, forestry, and agriculture as well as Federal, State, and local Governments. ``(5) The National Academy of Sciences urged creation of a national program to improve the geographic competence of the United States general population and the school age population. ``(6) Geography is defined as a `core academic subject' within the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. ``(7) A recent National Geographic Society survey found that all 50 States and the District of Columbia recognize geography in their curricula or content standards, and an increasing number require geography for graduation and include geography in mandated statewide assessments. ``(8) Seven of 10 educators responding to a National Geographic survey felt their professional development opportunities in geography were inadequate and half believed their schools had inadequate basic materials for teaching geography. ``(9) The National Geographic Society has spent over 15 years pioneering an extraordinarily effective national program for improving the teaching of geography by engaging university faculty geographers and highly trained teachers in State Geographic Alliances dedicated to providing high quality professional development opportunities for kindergarten through grade 12 teachers. ``(10) More than 60 colleges and universities in all 50 States have received grants from the National Geographic Society to support State Geographic Alliances and their professional development programs. Alliance-trained kindergarten through grade 12 teachers and their higher education partners conduct workshops, develop localized teaching materials, and facilitate communication among thousands of teachers whose responsibilities include teaching of geography in various formats and grade levels. ``(11) A study by Mid-continent Research for Education and Learning that assessed student academic achievement in geography on the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that students taught by Alliance-trained teachers outperformed other students by almost 10 percent. ``SEC. 232.

Summary:"," Ensuring Removal of Terminated Providers from Medicaid and CHIP Act This bill amends titles XIX (Medicaid) and XXI of the Social Security Act to prohibit federal payment under Medicaid for nonemergency services furnished by providers whose participation in Medicaid, Medicare, or CHIP has been terminated.

The bill maintains those requirements and further requires a state to exclude from Medicaid participation any provider that has been terminated under CHIP. Furthermore, a state must exclude from CHIP participation any provider that has been terminated under Medicaid or Medicare. The bill also revises a state's reporting requirements with respect to terminating a provider under a state plan. A state shall require each Medicaid or CHIP provider, whether the provider participates on a fee-for-service (FFS) basis or within the network of a managed care organization (MCO), to enroll with the state by providing specified identifying information. When notifying the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that a provider has been terminated under a state plan, the state must submit this information as well as information regarding the termination date and reason. HHS shall review such termination notifications and, if appropriate, include them in a database or similar system, as specified by the bill. The bill prohibits federal payment under a state's Medicaid or CHIP program for services provided by an MCO unless: (1) thenbsp. State has a system for notifying MCOs when a provider is terminated under Medicaid, Medicare, or CHIP. And (2) any contract between the state plan and an MCO provides that such providers be excluded from participation in the MCO provider network. [end] "

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act of 2005''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: (1) The development of uterine fibroids is a common and significant health problem, affecting women, primarily of reproductive age, across all ages, racial backgrounds, and socioeconomic levels. (2) It is estimated that between 20 and 30 percent of women of reproductive age have clinically recognized uterine fibroids, and screening studies indicate the prevalence of uterine fibroids in women may be much higher. (3) Minority women are more likely to develop uterine fibroids, and through ultrasound screening of African American and Caucasian women for fibroids, it is estimated that more than 80 percent of African Americans and about 70 percent of Caucasians develop fibroids by the time they reach menopause and the tumors develop at younger ages in African Americans. (4) Symptomatic uterine fibroids can cause heavy bleeding, pain, and reproductive problems, including infertility. There is no known cause of uterine fibroids. (5) The presence of uterine fibroids is the most common reason for hysterectomies, accounting for approximately one- third of hysterectomies, or 200,000 procedures annually and 22 percent of African American women and 7 percent of Caucasians have hysterectomies for fibroids. (6) Over five billion dollars are spent annually on hysterectomies, at approximately $6,000 for each surgery. (7) The Evidence Report and Summary on the Management of Uterine Fibroids, as compiled by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of the Department of Health and Human Services, held that there is a ``remarkable lack of high quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of most interventions for symptomatic fibroids''. (8) Current research and available data do not provide adequate information on the rates of prevalence and incidents of fibroids in Asian, Hispanic, and other minority women, the costs associated with treating fibroids, and the methods by which fibroids may be prevented in these women. SEC. 3. RESEARCH WITH RESPECT TO UTERINE FIBROIDS. (a) Research.--The Director of the National Institutes of Health (in this section referred to as the ``Director of NIH'') shall expand, intensify, and coordinate programs for the conduct and support of research with respect to uterine fibroids.

Summary:"," Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996 - Requires that, on or after January 1, 1997, any statute enacted by the Congress must include specified findings and declarations about the Constitutional authority of the Congress in enacting such statute to preempt State and local laws. Makes it out of order for the Senate or House of Representatives to consider any legislation that does not include such declarations, unless a supermajority in either House vote otherwise. Amends Federal law to prohibit any executive department or agency from construing any statutory authorization to issue regulations as authorizing preemption of State law or local ordinance by rule-making or other agency action, unless the statute expressly authorizes issuance of preemptive regulations and the agency concludes that the exercise of State power directly conflicts with the exercise of Federal power under the Federal statute, such that the State statutes and the Federal rule promulgated under the Federal statute cannot be reconciled or consistently stand together. Provides for notice and opportunity for State comment when a Federal agency proposes preemptive rule making or other agency action. Requires each Federal agency to publish in the Federal Register a plan for periodic review of rules and regulations preempting State or local government powers. [end] "

SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: (1) Congress supports the goals of Indian self- determination and economic development. (2) Congress supports the efforts of Indian tribes to promote their economic development efforts, wherever possible, in cooperation with State and local governments and others. (3) The Puyallup tribe, a signatory to the 1854 Treaty of Medicine Creek, has a reservation in Washington State. (4) The Puyallup tribe, which operates gaming facilities pursuant to a compact with the State of Washington, is a significant source of jobs in the area of Tacoma, Washington. (5) The Port of Tacoma is an independent, municipal corporation that operates under State enabling legislation. (6) The Port of Tacoma is also a significant source of jobs in the area of Tacoma, Washington. (7) The Port of Tacoma is in the process of expanding its operations to provide greater economic opportunities for the City of Tacoma, Pierce County, and the State of Washington. (8) The Port of Tacoma's expansion requires the closure of the primary access road for one of the Puyallup tribe's gaming operations. Without this access road, the Puyallup tribe's gaming facility will no longer be economically viable at its current location.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Carbon Neutral Government Act of 2009''. SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE OFFSETS AND CREDITS. (a) Federal Authorities.--Subject to the requirements of this Act, each executive agency (as defined in section 105 of title V of the United States Code) and each legislative branch office is authorized to use appropriated funds to purchase either or both of the following in any open market transaction, that complies with all applicable procurement rules and regulations and is approved in accordance with subsection (c): (1) Qualified tradeable greenhouse gas offsets. (2) Qualified tradeable renewable energy credits. (b) Qualification of Offsets and Credits.--A tradeable greenhouse gas offset or renewable energy credit shall be treated as qualified for purposes of this section if the Secretary of Energy certifies the generator of such offset or credit. Upon the application of any person generating or planning to generate any such offsets or credits, the Secretary shall certify the generator if the Secretary determines that the generator meets, or will, upon implementation, meet, such requirements as the Secretary deems necessary, under rules promulgated by the Secretary, to ensure that the offsets or credits generated will represent the reduction of greenhouse gases as specified or estimated in the offset (in the case of an offset) or in the generation of the amount of renewable energy which the credit represents or is estimated to represent (in the case of a credit). A reduction in greenhouse gases that the Secretary determines would have occurred in the absence of the opportunity to sell an offset for such reduction shall not be treated as a qualified offset for purposes of this Act. (c) Approval of Open Market Transactions.--The Secretary of Energy shall promulgate rules, after notice and opportunity for comment, regarding the open market transactions (involving qualified tradeable greenhouse gas offsets and qualified tradeable renewable energy credits) that will be treated as approved for purposes of this Act. Such rules shall accommodate forward purchasing and crediting of offsets and credits on an estimated basis from small scale offset and renewable energy generators, and other open market transactions that are useful in enabling short-term purchases of greenhouse gas offsets and renewable energy credits to contribute meaningfully to the implementation of small scale offset and renewable energy generators. (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act: (1) Greenhouse gas offset.--The term ``greenhouse gas offset'' means the reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases that results from an action or actions undertaken for the purpose, among others, of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (including the generation of renewable energy), where: (A) such action or actions would not have occurred in the absence of the opportunity to sell an offset for the resulting reductions; (B) the party claiming credit for the reductions has acquired the exclusive legal rights to claim credit for the reductions; and (C) such exclusive legal rights can be verified and approved by the Secretary through an auditable contract path or other system established by the Secretary. (2) Greenhouse gas.--The term ``greenhouse gas'' includes carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. (3) Renewable energy credit.--The term ``renewable energy credit'' means all of the environmental attributes associated with a single unit of energy generated by a renewable energy source where: (A) those attributes are transferred or recorded separately from that unit of energy; (B) the party claiming ownership of the credit has acquired the exclusive legal ownership of all, and not less than all, the environmental attributes associated with that unit of energy; and (C) exclusive legal ownership of the credit can be verified and approved by the Secretary through an auditable contract path or other system established by the Secretary. (4) Renewable energy.--The term ``renewable energy'' means electric energy generated from solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, ocean (including tidal, wave, current, and thermal), geothermal, municipal solid waste, or new hydroelectric generation capacity achieved from increased efficiency or additions of new capacity at an existing hydroelectric project. (5) Tradeable.--The term ``tradeable'' when used in connection with an offset or credit means that the offset or credit is available for purchase and sale in an open and transparent market. (e) Effective Date.--The authority of section 1 shall take effect for fiscal years after the enactment of this Act.

Summary:", Carbon Neutral Government Act of 2009 - Authorizes federal agencies and legislative branch offices to purchase qualified tradeable: (1) greenhouse gas (GHG) offsets. And (2) renewable energy credits. Requires the Secretary of Energy to promulgate rules regarding approved open market transactions involving such offsets and credits. Requires such rules to accommodate forward purchasing and crediting of offsets and credits on an estimated basis from small scale offset and renewable energy generators and other open market transactions that help enable short-term purchases of offsets and credits to contribute to the implementation of such generators. Defines greenhouse gas offsets to mean a reduction in GHG emissions that results from actions that would not have occurred in the absence of the opportunity to sell an offset for the resulting reduction.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``American Land Sovereignty Protection Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations governing lands belonging to the United States is vested in the Congress under article IV, section 3, of the Constitution. (2) Some Federal land designations made pursuant to international agreements concern land use policies and regulations for lands belonging to the United States which under article IV, section 3, of the Constitution can only be implemented through laws enacted by the Congress. (3) Some international land designations, such as those under the United States Biosphere Reserve Program and the Man and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Scientific, Educational, and Cultural Organization, operate under independent national committees, such as the United States National Man and Biosphere Committee, which have no legislative directives or authorization from the Congress. (4) Actions by the United States in making such designations may affect the use and value of nearby or intermixed non-Federal lands. (5) The sovereignty of the States is a critical component of our Federal system of government and a bulwark against the unwise concentration of power. (6) Private property rights are essential for the protection of freedom. (7) Actions by the United States to designate lands belonging to the United States pursuant to international agreements in some cases conflict with congressional constitutional responsibilities and State sovereign capabilities. (8) Actions by the President in applying certain international agreements to lands owned by the United States diminishes the authority of the Congress to make rules and regulations respecting these lands. (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are the following: (1) To reaffirm the power of the Congress under article IV, section 3, of the Constitution over international agreements which concern disposal, management, and use of lands belonging to the United States. (2) To protect State powers not reserved to the Federal Government under the Constitution from Federal actions designating lands pursuant to international agreements. (3) To ensure that no United States citizen suffers any diminishment or loss of individual rights as a result of Federal actions designating lands pursuant to international agreements for purposes of imposing restrictions on use of those lands. (4) To protect private interests in real property from diminishment as a result of Federal actions designating lands pursuant to international agreements. (5) To provide a process under which the United States may, when desirable, designate lands pursuant to international agreements. SEC. 3.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``FHA Manufactured Housing Loan Modernization Act of 2007''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that-- (1) manufactured housing plays a vital role in providing housing for low- and moderate-income families in the United States; (2) the FHA title I insurance program for manufactured home loans traditionally has been a major provider of mortgage insurance for home-only transactions; (3) the manufactured housing market is in the midst of a prolonged downturn which has resulted in a severe contraction of traditional sources of private lending for manufactured home purchases; (4) during past downturns the FHA title I insurance program for manufactured homes has filled the lending void by providing stability until the private markets could recover; (5) in 1992, during the manufactured housing industry's last major recession, over 30,000 manufactured home loans were insured under title I; (6) in 2006, fewer than 1,500 manufactured housing loans were insured under title I; (7) the loan limits for title I manufactured housing loans have not been adjusted for inflation since 1992; and (8) these problems with the title I program have resulted in an atrophied market for manufactured housing loans, leaving American families who have the most difficulty achieving homeownership without adequate financing options for home-only manufactured home purchases. (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are-- (1) to provide adequate funding for FHA-insured manufactured housing loans for low- and moderate-income homebuyers during all economic cycles in the manufactured housing industry; (2) to modernize the FHA title I insurance program for manufactured housing loans to enhance participation by Ginnie Mae and the private lending markets; and (3) to adjust the low loan limits for title I manufactured home loan insurance to reflect the increase in costs since such limits were last increased in 1992 and to index the limits to inflation.

SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Securities Private Enforcement Reform Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that-- (1) excessive securities litigation is a serious burden on the national economy, diverting limited capital resources to less productive areas; (2) meritless lawsuits filed under Federal securities laws are making it harder for American companies to raise capital and attract experienced members to serve on their boards; (3) in the past 3 years, issuers of 1 out of every 12 stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange have been sued for securities fraud; (4) in the securities fraud area, the civil justice system is being transformed into a nonmerit-based, unjust system, in which professional plaintiffs extract settlements from entrepreneurs, regardless of the merits of the cases filed; (5) such securities lawsuits impose additional costs on publicly traded companies, often force them into bankruptcy, and create job losses within the economy; (6) such securities fraud lawsuits stifle the development of future products by compelling investment bankers and accounting firms, whose assistance is essential for accessing capital markets, to resist working with new venture firms because of the higher risk of litigation associated with them; and (7) reform in the securities fraud laws are needed to ensure that the courts can properly hear and adjudicate securities fraud cases. SEC. 3. PRIVATE CIVIL ACTION PROCEDURES.

In determining the percentages of responsibility, the trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the conduct of each person and the nature and extent of the causal relationship between that conduct and the damage claimed by the plaintiff. ``(B) For each defendant, the trier of fact shall then multiply the defendant's percentage of responsibility by the total amount of damage suffered by the plaintiff that was caused in whole or in part by that defendant and shall enter a verdict or judgment against the defendant in that amount. No defendant whose liability is determined under this subsection shall be jointly liable on any judgment entered against any other party to the action. ``(C) Except where contractual relationship permits, no defendant whose liability is determined under this subsection shall have a right to recover from another defendant any portion of the judgment entered against him. ``(3) Definition.--A defendant engages in `knowing securities fraud' only if he (A) makes a material representation with actual knowledge that the representation is false or omits to make a statement with actual knowledge that, as a result of the omission, one of his material representations is false; and (B) knows that other persons are likely to rely on that misrepresentation or omission. Reckless conduct by the defendant shall not constitute `knowing securities fraud'.

Direct pecuniary benefit shall not include ordinary compensation for services provided.''. SEC. 4. TIME LIMITATION ON PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine Conservation Area Designation and Management Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine Conservation Area established by this Act contains a series of ancient volcanos and underwater geological features in the Exclusive Economic Zone.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Liability Reform Act of 2007''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds that-- (1) the defects in the United States civil justice system have a direct and undesirable effect on interstate commerce by decreasing the availability of goods and services in commerce; (2) the spiraling costs of litigation and the magnitude and unpredictability of punitive damage awards and noneconomic damage awards have continued unabated for at least the past 30 years; (3) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized that a punitive damage award can be unconstitutional if the award is grossly excessive in relation to the legitimate interest of the government in the punishment and deterrence of unlawful conduct; (4) just as punitive damage awards can be grossly excessive, so can it be grossly excessive in some circumstances for a party to be held responsible under the doctrine of joint and several liability for damages that party did not cause; (5) as a result of joint and several liability, entities including small businesses are often brought into litigation despite the fact that their conduct may have little or nothing to do with the accident or transaction giving rise to the lawsuit, and may therefore face increased and unjust costs due to the possibility or result of unfair and disproportionate damage awards; (6) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation costs, small businesses face higher costs in purchasing insurance through interstate insurance markets to cover their activities; and (7) legislation to address these concerns is an appropriate exercise of the powers of Congress under clauses 3, 9, and 18 of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States, and the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Detaining Terrorists to Secure America Act of 2011'' SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following finding: (1) The United States and its international partners are in an armed conflict with violent Islamist extremist groups, including al Qaeda and associated terrorist organizations, that are committed to killing Americans and our allies. (2) In the last 2 years, terrorists have repeatedly attempted to kill Americans both here at home and abroad, including the following attacks, plots, or alleged plots and attacks: (A) A September 2009 plot by Najibullah Zazi--who received training from al Qaeda in Pakistan--to conduct a suicide bomb attack on the New York, New York, subway system. (B) A November 2009 attack by Nidal Malik Hasan at Fort Hood, Texas, that killed 13 people and wounded 32. (C) A Christmas Day 2009 attempt by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to detonate a bomb sewn into his underwear on an international flight to Detroit, Michigan. (D) A May 2010 attempt by Faisal Shahzad to bomb Times Square in New York, New York, on a crowded Saturday evening, an attack that was unsuccessful only because the car bomb failed to detonate. (E) An October 2010 attempt by terrorists in Yemen to send, via commercial cargo flights, 2 packages of explosives to Jewish centers in Chicago, Illinois. (F) A February 2011 plot by Khaled Aldawsari, a Saudi-born student, to manufacture explosives and potentially attack New York, New York, the Dallas, Texas, home of former President George W. Bush, as well as hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants, and a nightclub. (3) Since the September 11, 2001, attacks on our Nation, the United States and allied forces have captured thousands of individuals fighting for or supporting al Qaeda and associated terrorist organizations that do not abide by the law of war, including detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who served as planners of those attacks, trainers of terrorists, financiers of terrorists, bomb makers, bodyguards for Osama bin Laden, recruiters of terrorists, and facilitators of terrorism. (4) Many of the detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay provided valuable intelligence that gave the United States insight into al Qaeda and its methods, prevented terrorist attacks, and saved lives. (5) Intelligence obtained from detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay was critical to eventually identifying the location of Osama bin Laden. (6) In a February 17, 2011, hearing of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, the Secretary of Defense confirmed that approximately 25 percent of detainees released from the detention facility at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay are confirmed to have reengaged in hostilities or are suspected of having reengaged in hostilities against the United States or our allies. (7) Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an organization that includes former detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay among its leadership and ranks, has claimed responsibility for several of the recent plots and attacks against the United States. (8) Detention according to the law of war is a matter of national security and military necessity and has long been recognized as legitimate under international law. (9) Detaining unprivileged enemy belligerents prevents them from returning to the battlefield to attack United States and allied military personnel and engaging in future terrorist attacks against innocent civilians. (10) The Joint Task Force-Guantanamo provides for the humane, legal, and transparent care and custody of detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, notwithstanding regular assaults on the guard force by some detainees. (11) The International Committee of the Red Cross visits detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay on a quarterly basis. (12) The detention facility at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay benefits from robust oversight by Congress. SEC. 3. REAFFIRMATION OF AUTHORITY TO MAINTAIN UNITED STATES NAVAL STATION, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA, AS A LOCATION FOR THE DETENTION OF UNPRIVILEGED ENEMY BELLIGERENTS HELD BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. (a) Reaffirmation of Authority as Location for Detention of Unprivileged Enemy Belligerents.--United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is and shall be a location for the detention of individuals in the custody or under the control of the Department of Defense who have engaged in, or supported, hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners on behalf of al Qaeda, the Taliban, or an affiliated group to which the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40) applies. (b) Maintenance as an Operational Facility for Detention.--The Secretary of Defense shall take appropriate actions to maintain United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as an open and operating facility for the detention of current and future individuals as described in subsection (a). (c) Permanent Extension of Certain Limitations Relating to Detainees and Detention Facilities.-- (1) Limitation on transfer of detainees to foreign entities.--Section 1033(a)(1) of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111- 383; 124 Stat. 4351) is amended by striking ``during the one- year period'' and all that follows through ``by this Act'' and inserting ``the Secretary of Defense may not use any amounts authorized to be appropriated''. (2) Prohibition on construction of detention facilities in united states.--Section 1034(a) of such Act (124 Stat. 4353) is amended by striking ``None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act'' and inserting ``No funds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of Defense, or to or for any other department or agency of the United States Government,''. (d) Supersedure of Executive Order.--Sections 3, 4(c)(2), 4(c)(3), 4(c)(5), and 7 of Executive Order No. 13492, dated January 22, 2009, shall have no further force or effect.

Summary:"," Detaining Terrorists to Secure America Act of 2011 - Reaffirms that the US Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (Guantanamo), is and shall be a location for the detention of individuals in the custody or control of the Department of Defense (DOD) who have engaged in or supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners on behalf of al Qaeda, the Taliban, or an affiliated group to which the Authorization for Use of Military Force applies. Directs the Secretary of Defense to maintain Guantanamo as an open and operating facility for the current and future detention of such individuals.

(a) List of Fuels.--Section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)) (as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-58; 119 Stat. 1106)) is amended by striking the second clause (v) and inserting the following: ``(vi)(I) The Administrator shall have no authority, when considering a State implementation plan or a State implementation plan revision, to approve under this paragraph any fuel included in such plan or revision if the effect of such approval would be to increase the total number of fuels approved under this paragraph as of September 1, 2004 in all State implementation plans. ``(II) The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall determine the total number of fuels approved under this paragraph as of September 1, 2004, in all State implementation plans and shall publish a list of such fuels, including the states and Petroleum Administration for Defense District in which they are used, in the Federal Register no later than 90 days after enactment. ``(III) The Administrator shall remove a fuel from the list published under subclause (II) if a fuel ceases to be included in a State implementation plan or if a fuel in a State implementation plan is identical to a Federal fuel formulation implemented by the Administrator and shall reduce the total number of fuels authorized under the list published under subclause (II) appropriately. ``(IV) Subclause (I) shall not limit the Administrator's authority to approve a control or prohibition respecting any new fuel under this paragraph in a State's implementation plan or a revision to that State's implementation plan after the date of enactment of this Act if such new fuel completely replaces a fuel on the list published under subclause (II). ``(V) The Administrator shall have no authority under this paragraph, when considering any particular State's implementation plan or a revision to that State's implementation plan, to approve any fuel unless that fuel was, as of the date of such consideration, approved in at least one State implementation plan in the applicable Petroleum Administrator for Defense District. However, the Administrator may approve as part of a State implementation plan or State implementation plan revision a fuel with a summertime Reid Vapor Pressure of 7.0 psi. In no event shall such approval by the Administrator cause an increase in the total number of fuels on the list published under subclause (II) as of the date of consideration. ``(VI) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to have any effect regarding any available authority of States to require the use of any fuel additive registered in accordance with subsection (b), including any fuel additive registered in accordance with subsection (b) after the enactment of this subclause. ``(vii)(I) The provisions of clause (vi), including the limitations of the authority of the Administrator and the cap on the total number of fuels permitted, shall remain in effect until the harmonization of fuels under subclause V of this clause is accomplished. Once such harmonization has been accomplished, clause (v) shall sunset and the limitations of the authority of the Administrator under subclause (IV) of this clause shall apply. ``(II) The Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy (hereinafter in this clause referred to as the `Secretary'), shall identify and publish in the Federal Register, within 12 months after the enactment of this subclause and after notice and opportunity for public comment, a list of 5 gasolines and diesel fuels to be used in States that have not received a waiver under section 209(b) of this Act. The list shall be referred to as the `Federal Fuels List' and shall include one Federal on-road diesel fuel (which shall grandfather the sulfur phase down in the Administrator's ultra low sulfur diesel fuel regulations in effect as of the date of enactment and shall permit the implementation of one alternative diesel fuel, approved under this subparagraph before enactment of this subclause for a State that has not received a section 209(b) waiver, only in the State in which it was approved prior to enactment), one conventional gasoline for ozone attainment areas, one reformulated gasoline (RFG) meeting the requirements of subsection (k), and 2 additional gasolines with Reid vapor pressure (RVP) controls for use in ozone attainment areas of varying degrees of severity. None of the fuels identified under this subclause shall control fuel sulfur or toxics levels beyond levels required by regulations of the Administrator. ``(III) Gasolines and diesel fuels shall be included on the Federal Fuels List based on the Administrator's analysis of their ability to reduce ozone emissions to assist States in attaining established ozone standards under this Act, and on an analysis by the Secretary that the adoption of the Federal Fuels List will not result in a reduction in supply or in producibility, including that caused by a reduction in domestic refining capacity as a result of the adoption of the Federal Fuels List. In the event the Secretary concludes that adoption of the Federal Fuels List will result in a reduction in supply or in producibility, the Administrator and the Secretary shall report that conclusion to Congress, and suspend implementation of this clause. The Administrator and the Secretary shall conduct the study required under section 1541(c) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 on the timetable required in that section to provide Congress with legislative recommendations for modifications to the proposed Federal Fuels List only if the Secretary concludes that adoption of the Federal Fuels List will result in a reduction in supply or in producibility. ``(IV) Upon publication of the Federal Fuels List, the Administrator shall have no authority, when considering a State implementation plan or State implementation plan revisions, to approve under this subparagraph any fuel included in such plan or plan revision if the proposed fuel is not one of the fuels on the Federal Fuels List; or to approve a State's plan or plan revision to move from one fuel on the Federal Fuels List to another unless, after consultation with the Secretary, the Administrator publishes in the Federal Register, after notice and opportunity for public comment, a finding that, in the Administrator's judgment, such plan or plan revision to adopt a different fuel on the Federal Fuels List will not cause fuel supply or distribution disruptions in the affected area or contiguous areas. The Administrator's finding shall include an assessment of reasonably foreseeable supply or distribution emergencies that could occur in the affected area or contiguous area and how adoption of the particular fuel revisions would effect alternative supply options during reasonably foreseeable supply or distribution emergencies. ``(V) The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, shall develop a plan to harmonize the currently approved fuels in State implementation plans with the fuels included on the Federal Fuels List and shall promulgate implementing regulations for this plan not later than 18 months after enactment of this subclause. This harmonization shall be fully implemented by the States by December 31, 2008.''. (b) Boutique Fuels.--Section 1541 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-58; 119 Stat. 1106) is amended by striking subsection (c) and inserting the following: ``(c) Study and Report to Congress on Boutique Fuels.-- ``(1) Joint study.--The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of Energy shall undertake a study of the effects on air quality, on the number of fuel blends, on fuel availability, on fuel fungibility, and on fuel costs of the State plan provisions adopted pursuant to section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)). ``(2) Focus of study.--The primary focus of the study required under paragraph (1) shall be to determine how to develop a Federal fuels system that maximizes motor fuel fungibility and supply, preserves air quality standards, and reduces motor fuel price volatility that results from the proliferation of boutique fuels, and to recommend to Congress such legislative changes as are necessary to implement such a system.

The Administrator and the Secretary shall coordinate the study required by this section with other studies required by the act and shall endeavor to avoid duplication of effort with regard to such studies. ``(4) Responsibility of administrator.--In carrying out the study required by this section, the Administrator shall coordinate obtaining comments from affected parties interested in the air quality impact assessment portion of the study.

FINDINGS. ``Congress finds the following: ``(1) Although 7,500,000 children under the age of 18 require mental health services, fewer than 1 in 5 of these children receive the services. ``(2) Across the United States, counseling professionals are stretched thin, and often students do not get the help the students need. The current national average ratio of students to counselors in elementary and secondary schools is 513:1. ``(3) United States schools need more mental health professionals, and the flexibility to hire the professionals that will best serve their students. ``(4) The maximum recommended ratio of-- ``(A) students to counselors is 250:1; ``(B) students to psychologists is 1,000:1; and ``(C) students to social workers is 800:1. ``(5) In States like California or Minnesota, 1 counselor typically serves more than 1,000 students. In some schools, no counselor is available to assist students in times of crisis, or at any other time. In Colorado, the average student-to- counselor ratio is 645:1. ``(6) The number of students is expected to grow significantly over the next few years. During this time, many school-based mental health professionals who currently serve our Nation's youth will retire.

(C) According to the 2012 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds, the assets of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted by 2024. (2)(A) The Trustees of these trust funds strongly encourage action to protect the solvency of the trust funds. (B) In their message to the public, included in the 2012 Annual Reports, the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees wrote, ``Lawmakers should not delay addressing the long-run financial challenges facing Social Security and Medicare. If they take action sooner rather than later, more options and more time will be available to phase in changes so that the public has adequate time to prepare.''. (3) Social Security and Medicare are meant to provide a secure and stable base so that older Americans can live in dignity. (4) Protecting the future surpluses of these trust funds can only occur when meaningful reform has been enacted by Congress. Any path to solvency must include the protection of future surpluses.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Breast Implant Research and Information Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) According to the Institute of Medicine, it is estimated that 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 American women have received breast implants over the last 35 years. Because there has never been a patient registry for breast implant recipients it is impossible to more accurately determine the number of women who have received breast implants. Yet, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons estimates that in 1999 alone 82,975 women had breast reconstruction following mastectomies and another 167,318 American women received breast implants for cosmetic purposes. (2) From 1985 until January 2000, FDA received 127,770 adverse reaction reports for silicone gel-filled breast implants and 65,720 adverse reaction reports for saline-filled implants. (3) Women need complete and accurate information about the potential health risks and advantages of breast implants so that women can make informed decisions. (4) Silicone breast implants have never been approved by the Food and Drug Administration; saline breast implants, which consist of a saline solution injected into a silicone envelope, were approved by the agency in 2000 despite alarmingly high complication and reoperation rates. After three years, 43 percent of the augmentation patients and 73 percent of the reconstruction patients experienced local complications and 40 percent of the reconstruction patients were forced to undergo additional surgery for local complications and device failure. (5) In 1998, the Food and Drug Administration opened a criminal investigation following allegations that one of the breast implant manufacturers was manipulating research data in breast implant studies. When the Food and Drug Administration's General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel convened in March 2000 to consider market approval for saline implants, it was not informed of the investigation. Although the manufacturer's saline breast implant was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in May 2000, the investigation remains open. (6) According to a 1997 Mayo Clinic study, within 5 years of receiving such implants, 1 in 4 women required additional surgery. (7) In 2000, research sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration found that even among women who had not sought medical treatment for implant problems, almost 70 percent had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years. Silicone was found to be migrating away from the implants in 21 percent of those women. The FDA researchers concluded that ``the relationship of free silicone to development or progression of disease is unknown''. (8) A 1993 study by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al., University of California, published in The Journal of Autoimmunity, investigated the influence of silicone breast implants on the expression of anticollagen antibodies and found a statistically significant incidence of anticollagen antibodies in women with implants. The researchers concluded that silicone breast implants should not be considered a benign or immunologically inert material; serious implications may result from their use. (9) The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study of silicone breast implant safety found that local complications with silicone breast implants were the primary safety issue, that they have not been well studied, and that information on these complications is crucial for women deciding whether or not they want breast implant surgery. Concern remains that exposure to silicone breast implants may result in currently undefined connective tissue or autoimmune diseases. (10) A 2001 National Cancer Institute study found breast implant recipients suffer from higher rates of lung and brain cancer than other plastic surgery patients. (11) A 1999 case report by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al., University of California, published in The Journal of Rheumatology, found evidence of silicone migration in women with ruptured or leaking silicone breast implants. These patients experienced severe local inflammation and complications resulting from silicone migration to the axilla, arm or abdominal wall. Researchers concluded that once silicone gel leaves the implant, it is not biologically inert and in some persons can elicit profound pathologic responses. (12) According to many reports, including a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the presence of a silicone breast implant may create difficulties in obtaining accurate and thorough mammograms because as much as 40 percent of the breast tissue can be masked by the implant. This delays the early detection of breast cancer in women. (13) According to a 2000 Food and Drug Administration publication, women of childbearing age who want to breast feed should be aware of the negative impact of breast implants on breast feeding. It is not known if a small amount of silicone may pass from the silicone shell of an implant into breast milk. If this occurs, it is not known what effect it may have on the nursing infant. (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to promote research to identify and evaluate the health effects of breast implants, to ensure that women receive accurate information about such implants and to encourage the Food and Drug Administration to conclude its criminal investigation based on the allegations of wrong-doing by one of the implant manufacturers which ultimately may affect their products and the health of American women. (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect any rule or regulation promulgated under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S. 301 et seq.) that is in effect on the date of enactment of this Act relating to the availability of silicone breast implant for reconstruction after mastectomy, correction of congenital deformities, or replacement for ruptured silicone implants for augmentation. SEC. 3. EXPANSION AND INTENSIFICATION OF ACTIVITIES REGARDING SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. (a) Status of Existing Research.--The Director of the National Institutes of Health shall report to all appropriate committees of Congress on the status of the existing breast implant research funded by such Institutes within 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. (b) Amendment to Public Health Service Act.--Part H of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end of the following: ``SEC. 498C. BREAST IMPLANT RESEARCH. ``(a) Institute-Wide Coordinator.--The Director of NIH shall appoint an appropriate official of the Department of Health and Human Services to serve as the National Institutes of Health coordinator regarding breast implant research. Such coordinator shall encourage and coordinate the participation of all appropriate Institutes research including-- ``(1) the Office of Research on Women's Health; ``(2) the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; ``(3) the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin diseases; ``(4) the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; ``(5) the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; ``(6) the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; and ``(7) the National Cancer Institute. ``(b) Study Sections.--The Director of NIH shall establish a study section or special emphasis panel if determined to be appropriate, for the National Institutes of Health to review extramural research grant applications regarding breast implants to ensure the appropriate design and high quality of such research and shall take appropriate action to ensure the quality of intramural research activities. ``(c) Clinical Study.-- ``(1) In general.--The Director of NIH shall conduct or support research to expand the understanding of the health implications of both saline and silicone breast implants. Such research should, if determined to be scientifically appropriate, include multidisciplinary, clinical, case- controlled study of women with breast implants for at least eight years whether it be one prosthesis or multiple, and differentiate between women receiving implants for mastectomy, reconstructive or cosmetic purposes and include subsets of women with saline implants and silicone implants. Such a study should focus on the rate of local complications which includes capsular contracture, leakage, loss of nipple sensation, deflation and rupture as well the presentation of atypical symptoms, silicone migration, neurological dysfunction, and immune system irregularities, and evaluate to what extent if any, their health differs from that of suitable controls. ``(2) Annual report.--The Director of NIH shall annually prepare and submit to the appropriate Committees of Congress a report concerning the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1).''. SEC. 4. INTENSIFICATION OF ACTIVITIES REGARDING POSTMARKET RESEARCH OF SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS AT THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Economic Growth and Development Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) The promotion of sustainable economic growth is the only long-term solution to lifting people out of poverty and addressing development challenges such as infectious disease, food security, access to education, and access to clean water, as reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit on September 25, 2015. (2) Several of the greatest development success stories of the past 50 years demonstrate that private sector investment and economic growth are fundamental to lifting populations out of poverty. (3) A dramatic shift in the composition of capital flows to the developing world necessitates a new approach to official development assistance; whereas 40 years ago more than 70 percent of capital flowing to developing countries was public sector foreign assistance, today over 80 percent of capital flowing to the developing world comes from the private sector. (4) In order to better leverage United States foreign assistance dollars and to promote sustainable economic development in partner countries, the United States Government must seek to promote economic growth through private sector investment by consulting United States business during development planning and programming processes. (5) Eleven of the 15 largest importers of United States goods and services are countries that graduated from United States foreign assistance, and 12 of the 15 fastest growing markets for United States exports are former United States foreign assistance recipients. (6) With 12 departments, 26 agencies, and more than 60 Federal Government offices involved in the delivery of United States foreign assistance and the promotion of United States investment overseas, it is unnecessarily difficult for United States businesses to navigate this bureaucracy in search of opportunities to partner with such United States agencies. (7) Although many United States development agencies have taken steps to improve the private sector coordination capabilities of such agencies in recent years, these agency- specific strategies are not integrated into a coherent interagency coordination structure to effectively engage the private sector. (8) The United States Government has no streamlined, interagency mechanism for coordination with the private sector for the purposes of development or promotion of opportunities for investment, nor are the activities of the United States Government in this area guided by a coherent set of strategic objectives, targets, or operating principles. (9) Whether in the context of a country, sector, or global development strategy, decisions regarding program prioritization and resource allocation would benefit greatly from private sector perspectives and market data and coordination with the private sector from the outset. (10) Development programs can be designed to better attract private sector investment and to promote public-private partnerships in key development sectors. (11) The Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Partnership for Growth both analyze constraints on growth as part of the planning processes of these organizations, but these analyses need to be included in agency country, sector, and global development strategies to more effectively inform and guide the full spectrum of United States development programs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act: (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means-- (A) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate; and (B) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives. (3) Private sector.--The term ``private sector'' means for- profit United States businesses. (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of State. (5) United states development agencies.--The term ``United States development agencies'' means-- (A) the Department of State; (B) the United States Agency for International Development; (C) the Millennium Challenge Corporation; (D) the Overseas Private Investment Corporation; (E) the Trade and Development Agency; (F) the Inter-American Foundation; and (G) the African Development Foundation. SEC. 4. PURPOSE. The purpose of this Act is to maximize the impact of United States development programs by-- (1) enhancing coordination between United States development agencies and the programs of such agencies and the private sector and the investment activities of the private sector; (2) integrating private sector input into the planning and programming processes of United States development agencies; (3) institutionalizing analyses of constraints on growth and investment throughout the planning and programming processes of United States development agencies; (4) ensuring United States development agencies are accountable for improving coordination between United States development programs and private sector investment activities; and (5) promoting and facilitating private sector investment. SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE. It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) United States development assistance should be pursued in a way that aims-- (A) to build and strengthen civic institutions; (B) to provide for public accountability; and (C) to serve as the basis for a democratic social contract between the people and their government, and as a basis for graduation from assistance; (2) United States Government policies and decisions should be guided by clear benchmarks for the evaluation of partner country commitment to funding development priorities, including the ``investing in people'' metric of the Millennium Challenge Corporation; (3) United States Government programs should be guided by a unified strategy, ambitious targets, and a robust monitoring, evaluation, and public accountability plan; (4) United States development assistance should aim to help build the capacity of partner countries to raise and commit partner country resources toward development goals, including-- (A) the capacity to increase revenues; (B) transparent budgeting and expenditures; (C) policies and laws that increase domestic investment; and (D) the ability to address the illicit flows of capital from domestic and international sources; (5) the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, reached at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, and the emphasis of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on economic growth and the commitment of greater domestic resources towards development goals, serves as a basis for concrete actions by donors and partner countries to achieve greater accountability and to foster broad-based economic growth and the establishment of prosperous, middle class-based societies; (6) domestic resource commitments and domestic resource mobilization for development purposes provide a greater chance for sustainability and an alignment of incentives among stakeholders, including donors, partner countries, citizens, and the private sector that drives economic growth; (7) the domestic resource commitments described in paragraph (6) are opportunities to provide for greater accountability and the building of strong, just social contracts between people and their governments, allowing governments to raise revenue, address citizen priorities, and be held accountable for results; (8) fostering domestic capacity and domestic responsibility for outcomes is the basis of true country ownership and a transition from assistance to sustainability by achieving development goals; (9) public sector development finance programs, which mobilize private capital to achieve development objectives, are projected to soon overtake traditional grant-based assistance as measured by total capital investments, reflecting an increasing recognition by both donor and recipient countries of the potential that development finance holds for driving inclusive, sustainable economic growth; (10) United States development finance programs should be used for development purposes, complement but not displace private capital, and operate free of political agendas; (11) while the United States has the ability to carry out development finance programs through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Development Credit Authority of the United States Agency for International Development, and the United States Trade and Development Agency, that ability is under-appreciated as a matter of policy and underutilized as a matter of development strategy; (12) the Overseas Private Investment Corporation lacks certain development finance tools, including the ability to make limited equity investments in projects rather than issuing debt and the authority and resources to provide first-loss guarantees or technical assistance; (13) the Overseas Private Investment Corporation is also limited by uncertainty around the renewal of its legal authorities and would be more effective with the stability and predictability provided by a multi-year authorization and a reformulation of how the agency may use its proceeds for essential staff and overhead expenses while still returning money to the Treasury; and (14) United States development assistance should prioritize and better coordinate resources that support enhanced trade capacity and facilitate fairer and more sustainable trade with partner countries. SEC. 6. INTERAGENCY STRATEGY AND MECHANISM TO COORDINATE UNITED STATES DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES. (a) In General.--The President shall establish a primary, interagency mechanism to assist the private sector in coordinating United States development programs with private sector investment activities. (b) Duties.--The mechanism established under subsection (a) shall-- (1) streamline and integrate the various private sector liaison, coordination, and investment promotion functions of United States development agencies; (2) facilitate the use of various development and finance tools across United States development agencies to attract greater private sector participation in development activities; and (3) establish a single point of contact for the private sector for partnership opportunities with United States development agencies.

(2) Elements of the annual strategy.--The annual strategy required under paragraph (1) shall include-- (A) country, sectoral, and global targets for private sector investment facilitation and coordination; (B) a description of the specific roles and responsibilities of United States Government departments and agencies involved in meeting the targets described in subparagraph (A), including within United States missions in-country; and (C) a plan relating to monitoring, evaluation, and public accountability. SEC. 7. INTEGRATING PRIVATE SECTOR COORDINATION IN COUNTRY, SECTOR, AND GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES. The Secretary and the Administrator shall direct their respective policy teams, including the Assistant to the Administrator for the Bureau of Policy, Planning and Learning, and country teams, to include private sector facilitation and coordination in all country, sector, and global development strategies, including integrated country strategies, regional and functional strategies, country development cooperation strategies, mission strategic resource plans, and global development strategies. SEC. 8. ANALYSIS OF CONSTRAINTS ON GROWTH AND INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND SECTORS. (a) In General.--The Secretary, the Administrator, and the heads of other relevant Federal agencies shall ensure that analyses of rigorous, current constraints on growth and investment guide all country, region, and sector economic development strategies. (b) Matters To Be Included.--The analysis required under subsection (a) shall include the identification and analysis of-- (1) constraints posed by the inadequacies of critical infrastructure, rule of law, tax and investment codes, and customs and regulatory regimes of recipient countries, as appropriate; and (2) particular economic sectors that are central to achieving economic growth, such as agriculture, transportation, energy, and financial services. (c) Results.--The results of the analyses described under subsection (a) shall-- (1) be incorporated into the development strategies of United States development agencies; (2) be used to inform and guide resource allocations; and (3) be made available to the public, and for comment by all stakeholders, prior to finalization of development strategies.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Pakistani Temporary Protected Status Act of 2010''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The summer of 2010 produced Pakistan's worst flooding in 80 years. (2) The 2010 Pakistani floods began in July 2010 following heavy monsoon rains in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan regions of Pakistan and affected the Indus River basin. Flooding began on July 22, 2010, in the province of Baluchistan. (3) According to the United Nations, 20,000,000 people, one-eighth of the population, and nearly 62,000 square miles, one-fifth of the country, have been significantly affected by destruction of property, livelihood, and infrastructure. (4) The Pakistani Government reports that the floods have affected 82 of Pakistan's 122 districts. As a result, more than 12 million people require humanitarian assistance, with nearly 6 million victims lacking access to food, shelter, and water. (5) The Pakistani Government estimates that approximately 1.9 million houses were either damaged or destroyed and nearly 2,000 people have lost their lives. (6) Over 60,000 troops are involved in Pakistan's flood relief operations. (7) The floods severely devastated Pakistan's infrastructure including roads, bridges, schools, health clinics, electricity, and communications. More than 5,000 miles of roads and railways were washed away, along with some 7,000 schools and more than 400 health facilities. (8) In addition, about 17 million acres of Pakistan's most fertile croplands have been submerged by the floods, in a nation where farming is an economic mainstay. The waters have also killed more than 200,000 head of livestock, and washed away large quantities of stored commodities that feed millions throughout the year. (9) On August 14, 2010, the first documented case of cholera emerged in the town of Mingora. (10) On September 7, 2010, the International Labour Organization reported that more than 5.3 million jobs have been lost due to the floods. (11) Concerns are growing about the enduring toll of the disaster on Pakistan's overall economy, food supply, and political stability. (12) Temporary protected status allows aliens who do not legally qualify as refugees but are nonetheless fleeing or reluctant to return to potentially dangerous situations to temporarily remain in the United States. (13) Granting temporary protected status to nationals of Pakistan is consistent with the interests of the United States and promotes the values and morals that have made the United States strong. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of the Congress that the extraordinary and temporary conditions caused by flooding in Pakistan qualifies Pakistan for designation under subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 244(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(b)(1)), pursuant to which nationals of Pakistan would be eligible for temporary protected status in the United States. SEC. 4. DESIGNATION FOR PURPOSES OF GRANTING TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS. (a) Designation.-- (1) In general.--For purposes of section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a), Pakistan shall be treated as if it had been designated under subsection (b) of such section, subject to the provisions of this section. (2) Period of designation.--The initial period of such designation shall begin on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall remain in effect for 12 months. (b) Aliens Eligible.--In applying section 244 of such Act pursuant to the designation made under this section, subject to section 244(c)(3) of such Act, an alien who is a national of Pakistan is deemed to satisfy the requirements of section 244(c)(1) of such Act only if the alien-- (1) has been continuously physically present in the United States since July 22, 2010; (2) is admissible as an immigrant, except as otherwise provided under section 244(c)(2)(A) of such Act, and is not ineligible for temporary protected status under section 244(c)(2)(B) of such Act; and (3) registers for temporary protected status in a manner that the Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish. (c) Consent To Travel Abroad.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall give the prior consent to travel abroad described in section 244(f)(3) of such Act to an alien who is granted temporary protected status pursuant to the designation made under this section, if the alien establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Homeland Security that emergency and extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the alien require the alien to depart for a brief, temporary trip abroad. An alien returning to the United States in accordance with such an authorization shall be treated the same as any other returning alien provided temporary protected status under section 244 of such Act.

Summary:"," Pakistani Temporary Protected Status Act of 2010 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the extraordinary and temporary conditions caused by flooding in Pakistan qualifies Pakistan for designation under the Immigration and Nationality Act pursuant to which its nationals would be eligible for temporary protected status (TPS) in the United States. Designates Pakistan as a TPS-eligible country for an initial 12-month period. Sets forth related TPS eligibility requirements, including continuous US presence since July 22, 2010. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to give prior consent to such aliens for temporary trips abroad in emergency and extenuating circumstances. [end] "

Repeals the exemption of the Gulf of Mexico from oil and gas development and production requirements for the outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Prohibits the Secretary from approving any geological and geophysical exploration, development, or production plan, or any significant plan revision, or from granting any license or permit unless the Secretary certifies that: (1) such plan is in compliance with specified statutes, regulations, and legal authorities. And (2) all requisite authorizations have been issued for activities to be conducted under the plan. Requires the Secretary to consult with the Secretaries of Commerce or of the Interior regarding any endangered species or fisheries that occur in the proposed area of activity. Requires the Secretaries of Commerce or of the Interior to incorporate in environmental studies of areas or regions included in an oil and gas lease sale or other lease any takings of marine mammal species or stock from any other reasonably foreseeable activities when determining whether takings from specified OCSLA activities will have a negligible impact on a marine mammal species or stock, and not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such species or stock for taking for subsistence uses. Permits citizen suits against the United States and any other subject instrumentality or agency that is alleged to have approved a leasing program, lease sale, exploration plan or permit, or development and production plan, without having prepared an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment, or without having complied with other related requirements. Authorizes a person to commence a civil action on the person's own behalf to enjoin any person alleged to have failed to obtain proper authorization pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``National Capital Area Interest Arbitration Standards Act of 1995''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that-- (1) affordable public transportation is essential to the economic vitality of the national capital area and is an essential component of regional efforts to improve air quality to meet environmental requirements and to improve the health of both residents of and visitors to the national capital area as well as to preserve the beauty and dignity of the Nation's capital; (2) use of mass transit by both residents of and visitors to the national capital area is substantially affected by the prices charged for such mass transit services, prices that are substantially affected by labor costs, since more than \2/3\ of operating costs are attributable to labor costs; (3) labor costs incurred in providing mass transit in the national capital area have increased at an alarming rate and wages and benefits of operators and mechanics currently are among the highest in the Nation; (4) higher operating costs incurred for public transit in the national capital area cannot be offset by increasing costs to patrons, since this often discourages ridership and thus undermines the public interest in promoting the use of public transit; (5) spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the governmental entities that are responsible for subsidy payments for public transit services since local governments generally, and the District of Columbia government in particular, are operating under severe fiscal constraints; (6) imposition of mandatory standards applicable to arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area will ensure that wage increases are justified and do not exceed the ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund the increase; and (7) Federal legislation is necessary under Article I of section 8 of the United States Constitution to balance the need to moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining industrial peace. (b) Purpose.--It is therefore the purpose of this Act to adopt standards governing arbitration which must be applied by arbitrators resolving disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area in order to lower operating costs for public transportation in the Washington metropolitan area. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. As used in this Act-- (1) the term ``arbitration'' means-- (A) the arbitration of disputes, regarding the terms and conditions of employment, that is required under an interstate compact governing an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area; and (B) does not include the interpretation and application of rights arising from an existing collective bargaining agreement; (2) the term ``arbitrator'' refers to either a single arbitrator, or a board of arbitrators, chosen under applicable procedures; (3) an interstate compact agency's ``funding ability'' is the ability of the interstate compact agency, or of any governmental jurisdiction which provides subsidy payments or budgetary assistance to the interstate compact agency, to obtain the necessary financial resources to pay for wage and benefit increases for employees of the interstate compact agency; (4) the term ``interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area'' means any interstate compact agency which provides public transit services; (5) the term ``interstate compact agency'' means any agency established by an interstate compact to which the District of Columbia is a signatory; and (6) the term ``public welfare'' includes, with respect to arbitration under an interstate compact-- (A) the financial ability of the individual jurisdictions participating in the compact to pay for the costs of providing public transit services; and (B) the average per capita tax burden, during the term of the collective bargaining agreement to which the arbitration relates, of the residents of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and the effect of an arbitration award rendered pursuant to such arbitration on the respective income or property tax rates of the jurisdictions which provide subsidy payments to the interstate compact agency established under the compact. SEC. 4. STANDARDS FOR ARBITRATORS. (a) Factors in Making Arbitrary Award.--An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not make a finding or a decision for inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment without considering the following factors: (1) The existing terms and conditions of employment of the employees in the bargaining unit. (2) All available financial resources of the interstate compact agency. (3) The annual increase or decrease in consumer prices for goods and services as reflected in the most recent consumer price index for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. (4) The wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of the employment of other employees who perform, in other jurisdictions in the Washington, D.C. standard metropolitan statistical area, services similar to those in the bargaining unit. (5) The special nature of the work performed by the employees in the bargaining unit, including any hazards or the relative ease of employment, physical requirements, educational qualifications, job training and skills, shift assignments, and the demands placed upon the employees as compared to other employees of the interstate compact agency. (6) The interests and welfare of the employees in the bargaining unit, including-- (A) the overall compensation presently received by the employees, having regard not only for wage rates but also for wages for time not worked, including vacations, holidays, and other excused absences; (B) all benefits received by the employees, including previous bonuses, insurance, and pensions; and (C) the continuity and stability of employment. (7) The public welfare. (b) Compact Agency's Funding Ability.--An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not, with respect to a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment, provide for salaries and other benefits that exceed the interstate compact agency's funding ability. (c) Requirements for Final Award.--In resolving a dispute submitted to arbitration involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area, the arbitrator shall issue a written award that demonstrates that all the factors set forth in subsections (a) and (b) have been considered and applied. An award may grant an increase in pay rates or benefits (including insurance and pension benefits), or reduce hours of work, only if the arbitrator concludes that any costs to the agency do not adversely affect the public welfare. The arbitrator's conclusion regarding the public welfare must be supported by substantial evidence. SEC. 5. PROCEDURES FOR ENFORCEMENT OF AWARDS. (a) Modifications and Finality of Award.--In the case of an arbitration award to which section 4 applies, the interstate compact agency and the employees in the bargaining unit, through their representative, may agree in writing upon any modifications to the award within 10 days after the award is received by the parties. After the end of that 10-day period, the award, with any such modifications, shall become binding upon the interstate compact agency, the employees in the bargaining unit, and the employees' representative. (b) Implementation.--Each party to an award that becomes binding under subsection (a) shall take all actions necessary to implement the award. (c) Judicial Review.--Within 60 days after an award becomes binding under subsection (a), the interstate compact agency or the exclusive representative of the employees concerned may file a civil action in a court which has jurisdiction over the interstate compact agency for review of the award. The court shall review the award on the record, and shall vacate the award or any part of the award, after notice and a hearing, if-- (1) the award is in violation of applicable law; (2) the arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers; (3) the decision by the arbitrator is arbitrary or capricious; (4) the arbitrator conducted the hearing contrary to the provisions of this Act or other statutes or rules that apply to the arbitration so as to substantially prejudice the rights of a party; (5) there was partiality or misconduct by the arbitrator prejudicing the rights of a party; (6) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or bias on the part of the arbitrator; or (7) the arbitrator did not comply with the provisions of section 4.

Summary:"," National Capital Area Interest Arbitration Standards Act of 1995 - Provides for the adoption of mandatory standards and procedures governing the actions of arbitrators in the arbitration of labor disputes involving transit agencies operating in the Washington, D.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Protect the Homeland from North Korean and Iranian Ballistic Missiles Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) The United States Constitution indicates one of the first purposes of government is to provide for the defense of the American people. (2) North Korea continues to develop the Taepo Dong 2 long- range missile. (3) The United States intelligence community estimated that the Taepo Dong 2, when fully developed, could threaten the entire continental United States with a ballistic missile. (4) North Korea tested the Taepo Dong 2 missile over the Sea of Japan on July 4, 2006, in defiance of warnings from the United States, Japan, South Korea, and the People's Republic of China. (5) North Korea, in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1695 and 1718, launched a long range ballistic missile on April 5, 2009. This test demonstrates that North Korean long range ballistic missiles can now reach South Korea, Japan, and Guam and can travel 2,000 miles over Japan into the Pacific Ocean. (6) North Korea ordered inspectors out of the country and walked away from the 6 party talks on April 14, 2009. (7) North Korea has deployed the Musudan intermediate range ballistic missile which can threaten Okinawa and Guam, 200 No Dong missiles which can reach Japan, and 600 Scud missiles which threaten South Korea. (8) On April 29, 2009, North Korea threatened to conduct a nuclear test and an intercontinental ballistic missile unless the United Nations Security Council apologized for imposing sanctions against North Korea. (9) North Korea, in violation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1718, conducted a nuclear test on May 25, 2009. (10) North Korea's missile launch and nuclear test demonstrate present international diplomatic efforts are not sufficient to deter North Korea from developing, deploying, and launching missiles or developing nuclear technology. (11) North Korea has test-fired six short-range missiles off the country's east coast since the May 25, 2009, nuclear test. (12) Recently North Korea has asserted it is no longer bound by the armistice which ended the Korean War and has threatened war against the United States, South Korea, and Japan. (13) North Korea leads the world in missile proliferation. (14) North Korea is known to share ballistic missile technology with other weapons proliferating nations such as Iran. (15) North Korea aided Syria with its nuclear program. (16) The Director of the Missile Defense Agency said on June 9, 2009, ``The United States has fine-tuned its ability to shoot down long-range missiles that could be launched by North Korea based on a trio of tests mimicking such an attack.''. (17) On February 3, 2009, the Government of Iran successfully launched its first satellite into orbit--an act in direct violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737. (18) General Maples, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, recently said, ``Iran's February 3, 2009, launch of the Safir space launch vehicle shows progress in mastering technology needed to produce ICBMs.''. (19) On April 5, 2009, President Barack Obama said, ``So let me be clear: Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the United States, but to Iran's neighbors and our allies.''. (20) On May 19, 2009, the Government of Iran test-fired a new two-stage, medium-range, solid fuel, surface-to-surface missile, which can reach Europe, Israel, and United States forces deployed in the Persian Gulf Region. SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING NORTH KOREA'S AND IRAN'S LONG- RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILE TECHNOLOGY. Congress-- (1) acknowledges that North Korea's and Iran's long-range ballistic missile technology is improving and could be used to deliver chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons; (2) expresses concern that North Korea's and Iran's long- range ballistic missile technology poses a real threat to the United States homeland; (3) realizes missile delivery technology and warheads could be passed along to state and non-state actors; and (4) supports ballistic missile protection of United States allies and forward deployed forces but believes it should not come at the expense of the protection of the United States homeland. SEC. 4. DEPLOYMENT OF MISSILE DEFENSE INTERCEPTORS IN ALASKA AND CALIFORNIA. The Secretary of Defense shall deploy the following: (1) Not less than 40 ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska. (2) Not less than 4 ground-based interceptors at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. (3) Such number of ground-based interceptors at such other locations as the President determines appropriate. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE SYSTEM. Funds are hereby authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 2010 for the ground-based midcourse defense system of the Missile Defense Agency in the amount of $500,000,000.

Summary:", Protect the Homeland from North Korean and Iranian Ballistic Missiles Act - States the concern of Congress over North Korean and Iranian long-range ballistic missile technology and the spread of such technology. Expresses support for ballistic missile protection of US allies and forward deployed forces but also the belief that this should not come at the expense of US homeland protection. Directs the Secretary of Defense to deploy specified numbers of ground-based interceptors in Alaska and California and such number in other locations as determined to be appropriate by the President. Authorizes funding for the ground-based midcourse defense system of the Missile Defense Agency. [end]

Summary:"," E. coli Traceability and Eradication Act - Amends the the Federal Meat Inspection Act to require that specified slaughterhouses, processing establishments, and grinding facilities perform specified tests for the presence of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli in beef. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to make grants to assist certain slaughterhouses, processing establishments, and grinding facilities in complying with such requirements. Terminates grant assistance on December 1, 2013. Subjects imported trim, bench trim, and ground beef to the same testing requirements as domestic trim, bench trim, and ground beef. Defines enteric foodborne pathogen as live bacteriological matter that is commonly present in the digestive systems of animals for slaughter, including Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and salmonella, the presence of which in meat food products may indicate unsanitary conditions at the point of slaughter. Directs the Secretary to implement sampling protocols to enable the Food Safety and Inspection Service to rapidly trace potential adulteration and contamination of meat and meat food products by enteric foodborne pathogens to possible preceding sources of the adulteration and contamination, including preparation, packaging, and slaughtering establishments, to determine the original site source of the adulteration or contamination. Requires the Secretary: (1) if a meat or meat food product sample tests positive for adulteration or contamination by enteric foodborne pathogens, to conduct a trace to identify all sites of adulteration and contamination, including preparation, packaging, and slaughtering establishments, and to identify the original source of adulteration or contamination. And (2) if a raw ground meat sample tests positive for adulteration or contamination by enteric foodborne pathogens at a preparation, packaging, or slaughtering establishment, to require subsequent daily sampling at the establishment and any supplying establishments for a minimum of 15 consecutive days after the date on which the sample is collected.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Global Trade Requires Unmitigated Truth in Health (TRUTH) Act'' . SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) The rise of global trade has created both new commercial opportunities and new health risks. (2) Governments have the right and responsibility to protect their countries from the threat of disease. (3) Trade is responsible for contributing to the rapid spread of disease around the globe and increases the risk of a pandemic outbreak. (4) Those who participate in world trade, therefore, have a responsibility to promptly report and appropriately respond to infectious diseases on a timely basis to minimize the potential for global pandemics. (5) The World Health Organization has created the World Health Organization International Health Regulations to prevent, protect against, and control disease and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and that avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. (6) The failure of countries to be transparent and responsive to the existence or spread of disease in a country that is a member of the World Trade Organization threatens the free flow of goods and services that is a primary objective of the GATT 1994 and other agreements of the World Trade Organization. (7) The experience with the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003 should be a clear warning that the system of public health readiness can be easily compromised by delays in reporting the earliest cases of an outbreak by a country reluctant to publicize a problem with an economic downside, no matter the public health consequences. (8) If a country fails to abide by regulations which are designed to prevent, protect against, and control disease and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease without unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade, it may be necessary to take actions against that country which restrict or otherwise interfere with international traffic or trade in the best interest of public health. SEC. 3. WTO PROPOSAL. (a) Action by United States Trade Representative.--The United States Trade Representative shall-- (1) propose to the World Trade Organization that the rights and obligations of the World Trade Organization should take into account whether countries are undermining the trade system by failing to abide by the rules of other international organizations with regard to public health, specifically the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization; and (2) include in the proposal options for its implementation, such as-- (A) provisions that would give members of the World Trade Organization the right to impose sanctions or other punitive measures on members that have been found to violate the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization; and (B) membership criteria for current and potential members of the World trade Organization that would include the requirement to uphold the trade system by abiding by rules of other international organizations with regard to public health. (b) Report to Congress.--The United States Trade Representative shall report to the Congress, not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and not later than the end of each 90-day period thereafter, on steps the Trade Representative has taken to carry out subsection (a), and the results of those steps. SEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORT ON COUNTRY COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS. (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, not later than December 1, 2006, and not later than December 1 of each year thereafter, a full and complete report regarding the status of the compliance with and observance of the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization in each country that is a member of that Organization. (b) Contents.--Each report under subsection (a) shall include the following information: (1) The extent to which each country complies with and enforces the requirements contained in the International Health Regulations. (2) The extent to which each country uses effective epidemiological principles to detect, reduce, or eliminate the sources from which infection spreads, to improve sanitation in and around ports and airports, to prevent the dissemination of vectors, and, in general, to encourage epidemiological activities on the national level so that there is little risk of outside infection establishing itself in that country. (3) The steps that the Secretary has taken to alter United States programs or policies with respect to any country because of unsatisfactory compliance with the International Health Regulations. (4) For each country in which the report indicates that the country's health administration has failed to notify the World Health Organization within 24 hours of its being informed that the first case of a disease subject to the International Health Regulations, that is neither an imported case nor a transferred case, has occurred in its territory, or, within the subsequent 24 hours, has failed to notify the infected area, the extent to which the United States has taken or will take action to encourage such notifications. (5) The extent to which each country communicates frequent and detailed information to the World Health Organization about the presence of plague, cholera, yellow fever, avian influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and any other disease determined by the Secretary that is present in its country. The report shall describe whether each country communicates to the World Health Organization the number of cases and deaths at least once each week, and the precautions taken to prevent the spread of the disease, in particular the measures which are being applied to prevent the spread of the disease to other territories by vessels, aircraft, trains, road vehicles, other means of transport, and containers leaving the infected area. (6) What steps the government of each country has taken to ensure that ports and airports in its territory have at their disposal an organization and equipment adequate for the application of the measures provided for in the International Health Regulations. (7) What steps the government of each country has taken to make available, at as many of the ports and airports in a territory as practicable, an organized medical and health service with adequate staff, equipment, and premises, in particular facilities for the prompt isolation and care of infected persons, for disinfection, disinsecting, and deratting, for bacteriological investigation, for the collection and examination of rodents for plague infection, for collection of water and food samples and their dispatch to a laboratory for examination, and for other appropriate measures provided for by the International Health Regulations.

Summary:"," Global Trade Requires Unmitigated Truth in Health (TRUTH) Act - Requires the US Trade Representative (USTR) to: (1) propose to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that its rights and obligations should take into account whether countries are undermining the trade system by failing to abide by the rules of other international organizations with regard to public health, specifically the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization. And (2) include in the proposal specified options for its implementation. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and specified congressional committees on the status of the compliance with and observance of such Regulations in each member country of the Organization.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: (1) Cavernous angioma, also termed ``cerebral cavernous malformations'' or ``CCM'', affects an estimated 1,500,000 people in the United States. (2) Cavernous angioma is a devastating blood vessel disease that is characterized by the presence of vascular lesions that develop and grow within the brain and spinal cord. (3) Detection of cavernous angioma lesions is achieved though costly and specialized medical imaging techniques. (4) Cavernous angioma is a common type of vascular anomaly, but individuals may not be aware that they have the disease until the onset of serious clinical symptoms. (5) Individuals diagnosed with cavernous angioma may experience neurological deficits, seizure, stroke, or sudden death. (6) Due to limited research with respect to cavernous angioma, there is no treatment regimen for the disease other than brain and spinal surgery. (7) Some individuals with cavernous angioma are not candidates for brain surgery, and no treatment option is available for such individuals. (8) There is a shortage of physicians who are familiar with cavernous angioma and affected individuals may find it difficult to receive timely diagnosis and appropriate care. (9) Due to the presence of a specific disease-causing mutation, termed the ``common Hispanic mutation'' that has passed through as many as 17 generations of Americans descended from the original Spanish settlers of the Southwest in the 1590s, New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma in the world. Cavernous angioma affects tens of thousands of individuals in New Mexico. (10) Other States with high rates of cavernous angioma include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. (11) Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, agreed to May 13, 2009, which was adopted unanimously, expresses the sense of the Senate that there is a critical need to increase research, awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous malformations. (12) The National Institutes of Health promotes advances in biomedical research by supporting extramural research at institutes of higher education, in part through extramural centers of excellence. These centers promote research through a multidisciplinary, team-based approach in order to better understand complex biomedical systems and translate basic scientific discoveries into useful clinical applications. (13) To address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma in New Mexico and throughout the United States, there is a need for a Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center in order to provide a model medical system for other such centers, to facilitate medical research to develop a cure for cavernous angioma, and to enhance the medical care of individuals with cavernous angioma nationwide. (14) Given the existing programs and expertise at the University of New Mexico, the first coordinated, centralized Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center should be established at the University of New Mexico. SEC. 3. CAVERNOUS ANGIOMA CARE CENTER. Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 284 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``SEC. 409K.

SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Although title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, one section of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights' 1997 final policy guidance, entitled ``Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties'' published in the Federal Register on March 13, 1997, 62 Fed. Reg. 12034, included a determination that ``sexual harassment directed at gay or lesbian students that is sufficiently serious to limit or deny a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program constitutes sexual harassment prohibited by title IX under the circumstances described in this guidance.''. This language was unchanged in a 2001 update of the policy guidance entitled ``Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties'' for which a notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on January 19, 2001, 66 Fed. Reg. 5512. (2) That section of the 2001 ``Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties'' went on to state: ``Though beyond the scope of this guidance, gender-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, but not involving conduct of a sexual nature, is also a form of sex discrimination to which a school must respond, if it rises to the level that denies or limits a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the educational program..A school must respond to such harassment in accordance with the standards and procedures described in this guidance.''. (3) There is evidence that brings into question the degree to which the policy guidance on sexual harassment against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students is being implemented. For example, a 7-State study by Human Rights Watch of the abuses suffered by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students at the hands of their peers, published in ``Hatred in the Hallways: Violence and Discrimination Against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Students in U.S. Schools'' found that such students were often the victims of abuses. (4) A 2000 study by the American Association of University Women focused on implementation of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 more generally, and the findings of that study, published in ``A License for Bias: Sex Discrimination, Schools, and Title IX'', included a finding that many schools and universities have not established procedures for handling title IX-based grievances. (5) The 2001 report of the Surgeon General, entitled ``Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior'' notes that ``antihomosexual attitudes are associated with psychological distress for homosexual persons and may have a negative impact on mental health, including a greater incidence of depression and suicide, lower self-acceptance and a greater likelihood of hiding sexual orientation.''. It goes on to report: ``Averaged over two dozen studies, 80 percent of gay men and lesbians had experienced verbal or physical harassment on the basis of their orientation, 45 percent had been threatened with violence, and 17 percent had experienced a physical attack.''. (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for an examination of how secondary schools are implementing the policy guidance of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights related to sexual harassment directed against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students. SEC. 2. STUDY OF HOW EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTING THE POLICY GUIDANCE RELATING TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. (a) In General.--The United States Commission on Civil Rights (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Commission'') shall conduct a study of the 1997 final policy guidance entitled ``Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties'' published in the Federal Register on March 13, 1997, 62 Fed. Reg. 12034, and the application of such policy guidance. (b) Scope.-- (1) Nationwide.--The study shall be conducted nationwide. (2) Elements of study.--The study shall examine, at a minimum, with regard to secondary schools-- (A) the extent to which there exists sexual harassment against gay and lesbian students in secondary schools, using the applicable standards in the policy guidance of the Office for Civil Rights described in subsection (a); (B) the extent to which there exists gender-based harassment that negatively affects the learning environment of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students in secondary schools, applying the definition of such gender-based harassment contained in the 2001 update of the policy guidance entitled ``Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties'' for which a notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on January 19, 2001, 66 Fed. Reg. 5512; (C) the level of awareness by school officials and students of the policy guidance described in subsection (a); and (D) the level of implementation of such policy guidance. (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``secondary school'' has the meaning given the term in section 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801). SEC. 3. REPORTING OF FINDINGS. (a) In General.--Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall transmit to Congress and to the Secretary of Education-- (1) a report of the Commission's findings under section 2; and (2) any policy recommendations developed by the Commission based upon the study carried out under section 2. (b) Dissemination.--The report and recommendations shall be disseminated, in a manner that is easily understandable, to the public by means that include the Internet. SEC. 4. COOPERATION OF FEDERAL AGENCIES. (a) In General.--The head of each Federal department or agency shall cooperate in all respects with the Commission with respect to the study under section 2. (b) Information.--The head of each Federal department or agency shall provide to the Commission, to the extent permitted by law, such data, reports, and documents concerning the subject matter of such study as the Commission may request. (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``Federal department or agency'' means any agency as defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act, such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2002. (b) Availability.--Any amount appropriated under the authority of subsection (a) shall remain available until expended.

Summary:"," Directs the US Commission on Civil Rights to conduct a nationwide study, and report with policy recommendations to Congress and the Secretary of Education, on how secondary schools are implementing specified policy guidance of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights relating to sexual harassment directed against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 1999''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS OF CONGRESS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Consistent with the rights of the United States under the World Trade Organization, injurious dumping is to be condemned and actionable subsidies which cause injury to domestic industries must be effectively neutralized. (2) United States unfair trade laws have as their purpose the restoration of conditions of fair trade so that jobs and investment that should be in the United States are not lost through the false market signals. (3) The continued dumping or subsidization of imported products after the issuance of antidumping orders or findings or countervailing duty orders can frustrate the remedial purpose of the laws by preventing market prices from returning to fair levels. (4) Where dumping or subsidization continues, domestic producers will be reluctant to reinvest or rehire and may be unable to maintain pension and health care benefits that conditions of fair trade would permit. Similarly, small businesses and American farmers and ranchers may be unable to pay down accumulated debt, to obtain working capital, or to otherwise remain viable. (5) United States trade laws should be strengthened to see that the remedial purpose of those laws is achieved. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE TARIFF ACT OF 1930. (a) In General.--Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 753 following new section: ``SEC. 754.

Companies, businesses, or persons that have ceased the production of the product covered by the order or finding or who have been acquired by a company or business that is related to a company that opposed the investigation shall not be an affected domestic producer. ``(2) Commissioner.--The term `Commissioner' means the Commissioner of Customs. ``(3) Commission.--The term `Commission' means the United States International Trade Commission. ``(4) Qualifying expenditure.--The term `qualifying expenditure' means an expenditure incurred after the issuance of the antidumping duty finding or order or countervailing duty order in any of the following categories: ``(A) Plant. ``(B) Equipment. ``(C) Research and development. ``(D) Personnel training. ``(E) Acquisition of technology. ``(F) Health care benefits to employees paid for by the employer. ``(G) Pension benefits to employees paid for by the employer. ``(H) Environmental equipment, training, or technology. ``(I) Acquisition of raw materials and other inputs. ``(J) Borrowed working capital or other funds needed to maintain production. ``(5) Related to.--A company, business, or person shall be considered to be `related to' another company, business, or person if-- ``(A) the company, business, or person directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by the other company, business, or person, ``(B) a third party directly or indirectly controls both companies, businesses, or persons, ``(C) both companies, businesses, or persons directly or indirectly control a third party and there is reason to believe that the relationship causes the first company, business, or persons to act differently than a nonrelated party.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Colville National Forest Adaptive Management of Timber Resources Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Forest vegetation on Federal lands in the intermountain West, including eastern Washington and particularly the Colville National Forest in the State of Washington, is in an extremely overstocked condition due to fire exclusion and nonmanagement, resulting in unhealthy, low-vigor stands that are susceptible to disease, insects, and fire. (2) The value of this forest vegetation far exceeds the cost of managing these stands for a healthy, productive ecosystem, but the current regulatory structure of overlapping directives and planning documents hinders management of this forest vegetation in a manner necessary to achieve, simultaneously, healthy and productive ecosystems and community benefits. (3) The current regulatory structure and overall policy direction further hinder the flexibility of the Forest Service to plan and prepare projects that effectively consider local conditions and opportunities or capture market opportunities. (4) Federal budgetary limitations have reduced the trained and experienced Forest Service workforce below the level necessary to plan for and maintain healthy and productive ecosystems. At the same time the Forest Service is forced to spend a disproportionate amount of its resources on planning, with insufficient resources remaining to implement scientifically acceptable forest management activities. (5) Implementation of adaptive management techniques in selected areas of the Colville National Forest will provide a healthy ecosystem, provide for long-term national fiber needs, generate funds in excess of costs, and stimulate the economies of local, resource-dependent communities. (6) The scientific knowledge gained from projects conducted using the adaptive management techniques required under this Act will benefit similar forest stands throughout the intermountain West. (7) The economic knowledge gained from such projects will benefit management projects in all timber stands. SEC. 3. PURPOSES. The purposes of this Act are the following: (1) To combat the adverse human and environmental consequences of catastrophic wildfire, including immediate-term loss of life, vegetation, soil, water, and nearby land use, and long-term loss of land productivity and continuous resource flow. (2) To use a creditable, science-based, adaptive management approach to manage fire-generated, overstocked, small-diameter, stagnated forest stands to improve forest health, meet current and future environmental needs, and provide wood fiber for processing in dependent communities. (3) To demonstrate the cost-effective use of private contractors to perform substantive planning and plan implementation tasks for the Forest Service. SEC. 4. PREPARATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND EVALUATION OF ADAPTIVE FOREST MANAGEMENT IN COLVILLE NATIONAL FOREST. (a) Adaptive Management Research Plan Required.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall prepare and submit to Congress a research plan, including supporting environmental documents, that provides for the implementation and evaluation of controlled silvicultural treatment in fire-generated, overstocked, small-diameter, stagnated forest stands in designated areas of the Colville National Forest in the State of Washington for the purpose of testing the effect of adaptive management techniques in the treatment of such forest stands. (b) Areas Covered by Plan.--The research plan prepared under subsection (a) shall apply to the following areas of the Colville National Forest: (1) The approximately 110,000 acres of the Colville National Forest identified as economically suited for adaptive management techniques in the Forest Service study of 1989-1994 regarding creating opportunities. (2) Other lands in the Colville National Forest selected by the Secretary as having characteristics similar to the lands identified in paragraph (1). (c) Implementation of Plan.--The Secretary shall implement the research plan prepared under subsection (a) not later than the second full field season beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary may begin an initial demonstration project based on a preliminary draft of the research plan as soon as practicable in an area of approximately 10,000 acres. (d) Use of Private Sector.--Subject to the availability of funds for this purpose under subsection (e), the Secretary may use private contractors, including individuals and groups involved in the preparation of the study referred to in subsection (b)(1), in the preparation and implementation of the research plan required under subsection (a) and in monitoring the effects of the research plan under subsection (i). To the greatest extent practicable, such private contractors shall be selected from communities adversely affected by reductions in the timber sale program of the National Forest System. (e) Funding.-- (1) Establishment of special account.--To fund the preparation and implementation of the research plan required under subsection (a), the Secretary shall establish an account to be known as the ``Ecosystem Adaptive Management Demonstration Account''. (2) Funds for account.--There shall be allocated or transferred to the account the following: (A) A portion of the amount annually allocated to the Colville National Forest pursuant to any other provision of law, to be based on the proportion of the Colville National Forest subject to the research plan. (B) The amounts deposited pursuant to subsection (g)(3). (C) Any amounts borrowed under paragraph (3). (3) Borrowing authority.--To the extent necessary to fund startup costs under the research plan, the Secretary may borrow amounts from salvage sale accounts of the Forest Service or amounts available under the Act of June 9, 1930 (16 U.S.C. 576 et seq; commonly known as the Knutson-Vandenberg Act). The Secretary shall repay amounts borrowed, without interest, using funds deposited in the account under subsection (g)(3). (f) Use of Account.--The Secretary shall use amounts in the special account established under subsection (e) for-- (1) the design and implementation of research projects conducted under the research plan prepared under subsection (a), except that the Secretary shall use funds from other sources to cover any costs related to appeals or litigation concerning those projects; and (2) to the extent amounts remain available in the special account after expenditures under paragraph (1), vegetative management activities, fuels treatment, monitoring, and watershed improvement projects within the areas covered by the research plan. (g) Treatment of Receipts.--Receipts generated from the sale of forest products resulting from silvicultural treatments under the research plan prepared under subsection (a) shall be deposited or utilized as follows: (1) 25 percent shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury of the United States as a miscellaneous receipt, pursuant to the procedures specified in the fifth paragraph under the heading ``FOREST SERVICE'' in the Act of March 4, 1907 (34 Stat. 1270; 16 U.S.C. 499), and related laws. (2) 25 percent shall be provided to the State of Washington pursuant to the procedures specified in the sixth paragraph under the heading ``FOREST SERVICE'' in the Act of May 23, 1908 (35 Stat. 260; 16 U.S.C. 500). (3) 50 percent shall be deposited in the special account established under subsection (e). (h) Schedule of Silvicultural Treatments.--Silvicultural treatments under the research plan prepared under subsection (a) shall be conducted during the 10-year period beginning on the date the research plan is first implemented. The total number of acres treated in each of the first 5 years shall not vary by more than 20 percent from \1/10\ of the total acres covered by the research plan. (i) Monitoring and Reports.--The Secretary shall commence monitoring of the effects of research activities under the research plan prepared under subsection (a) immediately after implementation of the research plan. Monitoring activities shall continue for a period of not less than 15 years. At 5-year intervals during the monitoring period, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report containing the results of the monitoring, findings derived from the research projects under the research plan, and the implications of such findings for management of similar overstocked stands. Each report shall include a detailed accounting of direct costs and returns associated with the implementation of the research plan.

Summary:"," Colville National Forest Adaptive Management of Timber Resources Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct an adaptive forest management research program in Colville National Forest, Washington, which shall include silvicultural treatments.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Vessel Discharge Evaluation and Review Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) Starting with passage of the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships in 1980, the United States Coast Guard has been the principal Federal authority charged with administering, enforcing, and prescribing regulations relating to the discharge of pollutants from vessels engaged in maritime commerce and transportation. (2) There are more than 16 million State-registered boats, 110,000 commercial fishing vessels, and 53,000 freight and tank barges operating in United States waters. Since 1973 certain discharges incidental to the normal operation of these vessels have been exempted from regulation. (3) When required, Congress has specifically mandated Federal programs for control of discharges from vessels, including-- (A) the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980; (B) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4701 et seq.); (C) the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 (16 U.S.C. 4701 note); and (D) section 1401 of the 2000 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2001, which prevented discharge of treated sewage and graywater in certain areas of Alaska. SEC. 3. EVALUATION AND REVIEW OF CERTAIN DISCHARGES. (a) In General.--The Commandant of the Coast Guard, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and the head of any other appropriate agency or department of the United States, shall conduct an evaluation and review of vessel discharges, other than aquatic nuisance species, that are described in section 122.3(a) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on January 5, 1989. The evaluation shall include-- (1) a characterization of the various types and composition of such discharges by different classes of vessels; (2) the volumes of such discharges for representative individual vessels and by classes of vessels in the aggregate; (3) an analysis of current technologies or best management practices, and their associated costs, used to control such discharges; (4) an analysis of the extent to which such discharges are currently subject to regulation under existing Federal laws or binding international obligations of the United States; (5) the locations of such discharges; (6) analyses and conclusions as to the nature and extent of potential effects of such discharges on human health, welfare, and the environment; (7) an analysis of practicable measures, including best management practices, to control such discharges; and (8) recommendations as to steps, including regulatory changes, together with a schedule for implementation, that are appropriate to address such discharges. (b) Public Comment.--The Commandant shall-- (1) publish a draft report containing findings, conclusions, and recommendations from the evaluation and review required by subsection (a) in the Federal Register; (2) accept public comments regarding such draft for a period of not less than 120 days after the date the draft is published in the Federal Register; and (3) consider any such public comments in the preparation of the final report. (c) Final Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commandant shall prepare and submit to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure a final report containing findings, conclusions, and recommendations from the evaluation and review required by subsection (a). SEC. 4. DISCHARGES INCIDENTAL TO NORMAL OPERATION OF VESSELS. (a) Statement of Purpose.--The purposes of this section are-- (1) to provide for the establishment of nationally uniform, environmentally sound, standards for discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels; and (2) to establish procedures for designation of no discharge zones as necessary to protect waters within the jurisdiction of a State from the effects of discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels. (b) Evaluation and Review of Certain Discharges.--Subtitle B of the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4711 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following: ``SEC. 1105. REGULATION OF CERTAIN DISCHARGES. ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any requirement to obtain a permit for a discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel is suspended beginning on the date of enactment of the Vessel Discharge Evaluation and Review Act.

No such prohibition shall apply until-- ``(A) the Administrator determines that adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal of the relevant discharges are reasonably available for the waters to which the prohibition would apply; and ``(B) the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere determines that such prohibition does not create an undue burden on Commerce. ``(3) The Governor of any State may submit a petition requesting that the Commandant review the regulations promulgated under subsection (a) if there is significant new information, not available previously, that could reasonably result in a change to the regulation. The petition shall be accompanied by the scientific and technical information on which the petition is based. ``(d) Certain Discharges Unaffected.--Nothing this section shall be interpreted to apply to-- ``(1) a vessel of the Armed Forces; ``(2) a discharge of vessel sewage; or ``(3) any discharge not subject to the permit exclusion contained in section 122.3(a) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on March 29, 2005. ``(e) Exclusions.--No permit shall be required under any other provision of law for, nor shall any uniform national discharge standard promulgated under subsection (a) apply to-- ``(1) a discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel that is less than 79 feet in length and is-- ``(A) engaged in commercial service (as defined in section 2101(5) of title 46, United States Code); or ``(B) a recreational vessel (as defined in section 2101(25) of title 46, United States Code); or ``(2) a discharge of aquatic nuisance species in vessel ballast water or sediment or from other vessel-related vectors of aquatic nuisance species subject to section 1101 of the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4711); ``(3) the placement, release, or discharge of equipment, devices, or other material from a vessel for the sole purpose of conducting research on the aquatic environment or its natural resources in accordance with generally recognized scientific methods, principles, or techniques; ``(4) any discharge from a vessel authorized by an On-Scene Coordinator in accordance with part 300 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, or section 153.10(e) of title 33, Code of Federal Regulations; ``(5) discharges from a vessel that are necessary to secure the safety of the vessel or human life or to suppress fires onboard or at shoreside facilities; or ``(6) a vessel of the armed forces of a foreign nation when engaged in noncommercial service. ``(f) Incidental Discharge Defined.--In this section, the term `discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel'-- ``(1) means a discharge, including-- ``(A) graywater, bilge water, cooling water, weather deck runoff, ballast water, oil water separator effluent, and any other pollutant discharge from the operation of a marine propulsion system, shipboard maneuvering system, crew habitability system, or installed major equipment, such as an aircraft carrier elevator or a catapult, or from a protective, preservative, or absorptive application to the hull of the vessel; and ``(B) a discharge in connection with the testing, maintenance, and repair of a system described in subparagraph (A) whenever the vessel is waterborne; and ``(2) does not include-- ``(A) a discharge of rubbish, trash, garbage, or other such material discharged overboard; ``(B) an air emission resulting from the operation of a vessel propulsion system, motor driven equipment, or incinerator; or ``(C) a discharge that is not covered by part 122.3 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on Feb. 10, 1996). ``(g) Application with Other Statutes.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this section shall be the exclusive statutory authority for regulation by the Federal Government of vessel discharges to which this section applies.''.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Improved Budget Presentation Act''. SEC. 2. PURPOSE. The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission which will submit findings and recommendations to provide a more effective presentation of capital and operating expenses of the United States Government. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The Federal Government does not take a comprehensive look at capital investment programs across agency and program lines to see how they fit into a national strategy for maintaining and improving the Nation's public facilities. (2) Both the executive branch and the Congress tend to set priorities for physical capital investment program-by-program. There is no consistent basis for setting priorities among projects and programs, and there is no framework in which to identify those having similar objectives and those that are at cross-purposes. (3) This program- and project-orientation makes planning for public facilities vulnerable to short-term factors, thus impairing the stability and predictability needed for an efficient capital investment program. (4) A separate capital budget would establish a useful planning process because it would focus on long-term projects, costs, and benefits. SEC. 4. COMMISSION ON THE PRESENTATION OF THE BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES. (a) Establishment.--To carry out the purpose of section 2, there is established the Commission on the Presentation of the Budget of the United States (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Commission'').

(c) Completion of Appointments.--Appointment of the members of the Commission shall be completed within 30 days after the effective date of this Act. (d) Vacancies.--Any vacancy in the membership of the Commission shall not affect its powers, and shall be filled in the same manner in which the original appointment was made.

SEC. 5. DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION. (a) In General.--The Commission shall-- (1) study and investigate the manner in which all departments, agencies, independent establishments, and instrumentalities of the United States Government participate in the formulation and presentation of the United States Budget; and (2) make such recommendations as the members of the Commission consider appropriate to provide improved governmental processes in the formulation, presentation, and implementation of the United States Budget with respect to-- (A) the ability of the United States Budget to distinguish between capital activities and operating activities, and between operating funds and trust funds, to identify the resources needed to meet the Government's needs; (B) improved procedures among departments, agencies, independent establishments, and instrumentalities of the United States Government to provide improved coordination and control with respect to the formulation, presentation, and implementation of the United States Budget; and (C) more effective arrangements between the executive branch and the Congress, which will better enable each to carry out its budgeting, revenue, and appropriation responsibilities. (c) Report.--The Commission shall submit a comprehensive report to the President and the Congress by not later than 7 months after the effective date of this Act, containing the findings and recommendations of the Commission. Such recommendations may include proposed legislation and administrative actions the Commission considers appropriate. SEC. 6. POWERS OF THE COMMISSION.

(2) Five members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum, except that a lesser number may hold hearings. (b) Obtaining Information, Etc.--The Commission may request from any executive department, bureau, agency, board, commission, office, independent establishment, or instrumentality information, suggestions, estimates, and statistics for the purposes of this Act. Each such department, bureau, agency, board, commission, office, establishment, or instrumentality shall, to the extent not otherwise prohibited by law, furnish such information, suggestions, estimates, and statistics directly to the Commission, upon request made by the Chairman. SEC. 7. STAFF OF THE COMMISSION. The individual Commission members shall obtain staff support from their respective employing organizations. SEC. 8. TERMINATION. The Commission shall cease to exist on the 30th day after the date on which it submits its report under section 5(c).

Summary:"," Improved Budget Presentation Act - Establishes the Commission on the Presentation of the Budget of the United States to study and report to the President and the Congress on recommendations to provide improved governmental processes in the formulation, presentation, and implementation of the Federal budget with respect to: (1) the ability of the budget to distinguish between capital and operating activities, and between operating and trust funds, to identify the resources needed to meet the Government's needs. (2) improved procedures among Federal departments, agencies, independent establishments, and instrumentalities to provide improved coordination and control with respect to the budget. And (3) more effective arrangements between the executive branch and the Congress which will better enable each to carry out its budgeting, revenue, and appropriation responsibilities. [end] "

SECTION 1. KOREA VISA WAIVER PILOT PROGRAM. (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds that-- (1) travel and tourism play a major role in reducing the United States unfavorable balance of trade; (2) the characteristics of the Korean travel market do not permit long-term planning for longer trips; (3) applications for United States visas cannot now be processed in a reasonable period of time; (4) the Secretary of State has attempted to solve the problem by adding additional staff to the consular section at the United States Embassy in Seoul; (5) unfortunately, these additions have not resulted in any discernable improvement in reducing visa processing delays; (6) further, it is unlikely, given the current fiscal environment, to expect funding to be available for further staff additions in sufficient numbers to effect any significant improvement in the time required to process visa applications; (7) most of the nations of the South Pacific, Europe, and Canada do not currently require Koreans entering their countries to have a visa, thus providing them with a serious competitive advantage in the tourism industry; (8) the United States territory of Guam has been permitted by the United States Government to eliminate visa requirements for Koreans visiting Guam, with resultant impressive increases in travel and tourism from citizens of the Republic of Korea; (9) any application under existing procedures to add the Republic of Korea, or any other nation to the group of favored nations exempted from United States visa regulations, would require many years during which time the United States could well lose its competitive advantages in attracting travel and tourism from the Republic of Korea; (10) the Republic of Korea, as a gesture of goodwill, has already unilaterally exempted United States tourists who seek to enter the Republic of Korea from the requirement of obtaining a visa; and (11) growth in Korean travel to the United States has not kept pace with growth in travel to non-United States destinations, and cumbersome and time-consuming visa processing procedures are widely recognized as the cause of this loss of market share and competitiveness with alternative destinations. (b) Pilot Program.--The Secretary of State and the Attorney General jointly shall establish a pilot project (in this section referred to as the ``pilot program'') within six months of the date of the enactment of this Act under which the requirement of paragraph (7)(B)(i)(II) of section 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(7)(B)(i)(II)) is waived during the pilot program period in the case of any alien who meets the following requirements: (1) National of pilot program country.--The alien is a national of, and presents a passport issued by, the Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea is urged to provide machine readable passports to its citizens in the near future. (2) Seeking entry as tourist.--The alien is applying for admission to the United States during the pilot program period as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure (as described in section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(B))), as part of a group tour to the United States. (3) Period of stay.--The alien seeks to stay in the United States for a period of not more than 15 days. (4) Executes immigration forms.--The alien before the time of such admission completes such immigration form as the Attorney General shall establish. (5) Entry into the united states.--If arriving by sea or air, the alien arrives at the port of entry into the United States on a carrier which has entered into an agreement with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to guarantee transport of the alien out of the United States if the alien is found inadmissible or deportable by an immigration officer. (6) Not a safety threat.--The alien has been determined not to represent a threat to the welfare, health, safety, or security of the United States. (7) No previous violation.--If the alien previously was admitted without a visa under this section, the alien must not have failed to comply with the conditions of any previous admission as such a nonimmigrant. (8) Round-trip ticket.--The alien is in possession of a round-trip transportation ticket (unless this requirement is waived by the Attorney General under regulations). (c) Waiver of Rights.--An alien may not be provided a waiver under the pilot program unless the alien has waived any right-- (1) to review or appeal under this Act of an immigration officer's determination as to the admissibility of the alien at the port of entry into the United States, or (2) to contest, other than on the basis of an application for asylum, any action for deportation against the alien. (d) Termination of Authority.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, acting jointly, may terminate the pilot program under this section on or after a date which is one year after the date of the establishment of the pilot program if-- (1) during the preceding fiscal year, the overstay rate for nationals of the Republic of Korea entering the United States under the pilot program exceeds the overstay rate of such nationals entering the United States with valid visas; and (2) the Attorney General and the Secretary of State have jointly determined that the pilot program is leading to a significant increase in the number of overstays by such nationals. (e) Special Bond and Notification Requirements for Tour Operators.-- (1) In general.--Nationals of the Republic of Korea may not enter the United States under the terms of this section unless they are accompanied for the duration of their authorized admission period by a tour operator who has fulfilled the following requirements: (A) The tour operator has posted a bond of $200,000 with the Secretary of State. (B) The Secretary of State, under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, has approved an application by the tour operator to escort tour groups to the United States. (C) The tour operator provides the name, address, birthdate, passport number, and citizenship of all prospective tour group members to the Secretary of State no less than one business day prior to the departure date of the group, under such regulations as he may prescribe, in order to determine that the prospective travelers do not represent a threat to the welfare, health, safety, and security of the United States. (D) The tour operator excludes from the tour group any person whom the Secretary of State denies permission to travel to the United States. (E) The tour operator provides written certification or other such evidence prescribed by the Secretary of State and Attorney General which documents the return to Korea of each tour group member. (2) Forfeiture of bonds.--Bonds posted in accordance with this subsection shall be forfeited in whole or in part and a tour operator's authorization to escort tours to the United States may be suspended or revoked if the Secretary of State finds that the tour operator-- (A) has failed to disclose a material fact in connection with the application required under paragraph (1)(B); (B) fails to comply with the advance notification and refusal requirements of paragraphs (1)(C) and (1)(D); (C) has failed to take adequate steps to ensure that visitors who are being escorted to the United States under the terms of an approved application return to their country of residence; or (D) is found at any time to have committed a felony or any offense under the immigration laws of the United States. (f) Participation by Tour Agents.--The Secretary of State shall periodically review the overstay rate of nationals of the Republic of Korea that corresponds to each tour agent participating in the program under this section. The Secretary may terminate the participation in the program of any tour agent if the Secretary determines that the corresponding overstay rate is excessive. (g) Definitions.--For purposes of this section-- (1) Group tour.--The term ``group tour'' means travelers who take advantage of group-purchased hotel or airfare packages, as guided, supervised, and arranged by a tour agent in the Republic of Korea approved or licensed by the Department of State. (2) Overstay rate.--The term ``overstay rate'' means, during a specified period of time, the proportion that the number of aliens remaining in the United States after the expiration of their visas bears to the total number of aliens entering the United States during that period of time. (3) Pilot program period.--The term ``pilot program period'' means the three-year period immediately following the establishment of the pilot program.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Genomic Science and Technology Innovation Act of 2002''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) Genomic science promises a revolution in the development of new and effective genomic technologies and other innovations, and it is in the national interest to speed the development and deployment of these new technologies through policies that promote innovation in the field of genomic science and technology. (2) While Federal innovation policies can help stimulate innovation by attracting capital investment to the development of commercial products, such policies can also inhibit basic research and hinder sharing of information that is the basis of scientific progress, thereby slowing the innovation process. (3) Intellectual property policies for genomic science and technology products are being implemented without an adequate understanding and consideration of the net impact of such policies on the innovation process. (4) Decisions about intellectual property policy being made now are likely to have significant impacts on basic research and the development of genomic technology for decades to come. (5) The Office of Science and Technology Policy is uniquely positioned to lead the development of a coordinated, interagency policy to promote innovation in genomic science and technology. A definitive study coordinated by the Office of Science and Technology Policy that identifies the impacts of Federal innovation policy on the innovation pipeline for genomic technology and includes recommendations for policies, including any statutory changes needed to optimize the genomic technology innovation pipeline, would contribute significantly to the development of the policy. SEC. 3. STUDY.

SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Manufacturing Extension Partnership services are available in all 50 States and at 392 locations. (2) The Manufacturing Extension Partnership delivers critical services to small and midsized manufacturers, providing access to public and private resources that enhance growth, improve productivity, and expand capacity. (3) The Manufacturing Extension Partnership helps manufacturers position themselves as strong long-term competitors in domestic and international markets. (4) Of the 7 million jobs lost in the recession as of February 2009, over 2 million were from the manufacturing sector, and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership reported creating or retaining over 57,000 manufacturing jobs in the most recent surveyed year. (5) The Manufacturing Extension Partnership has delivered $1.44 billion in cost savings annually and $10.5 billion in increased or retained sales in a single year. (6) Every dollar contributed by the Federal Government to the Manufacturing Extension Partnership is matched 2-to-1 by State and local governments and participating manufacturers. (7) The recession has strained many State budgets, and 23 State Manufacturing Extension Partnership Centers reported a decrease or elimination of State funding in 2009. (8) When a State decreases or eliminates funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, the cost-share burden is shifted to small manufacturers who are unlikely to be able to afford increased contributions during an economic downturn, and the availability of Manufacturing Extension Partnership services is jeopardized. (9) A reduction in the matching requirement for participants in the Manufacturing Extension Partnership will greatly alleviate the burden on State budgets and small manufacturers and preserve the Manufacturing Extension Partnership's ability to provide critical services to small manufacturers and create much-needed jobs in the manufacturing sector. SEC. 2. HOLLINGS MANUFACTURING EXTENSION PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. Section 25(c) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278k(c)) is amended-- (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, unless otherwise determined under paragraph (3)(C)'' before the period at the end; (2) in paragraph (3)-- (A) in subparagraph (B)-- (i) by striking ``not less than 50 percent of the costs incurred for the first 3 years and an increasing share for each of the last 3 years'' and inserting ``the applicant's share of the costs incurred (in this subsection referred to as `cost share')''; and (ii) by striking ``For purposes of the preceding sentence, the'' and inserting ``The''; (B) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) and (D) as subparagraphs (D) and (E), respectively; (C) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new subparagraph: ``(C) The Secretary shall by rule establish appropriate criteria to be considered in determining a Center's cost share. A Center's cost share shall in no case exceed 50 percent of the costs incurred by such Center. The Secretary shall review each Center's cost share annually and at such other times as the Secretary considers appropriate. An adjustment to a Center's cost share in a year shall not affect the amount of Federal funds such Center receives in such year.''; and (D) in subparagraph (D), as redesignated by subparagraph (B)-- (i) by striking ``50 percent'' and inserting ``cost share''; and (ii) by striking ``Center's contribution'' and inserting ``Center's cost share''; and (3) in paragraph (5)-- (A) in the 6th sentence, by striking ``at declining levels''; and (B) in the last sentence-- (i) by striking ``Funding'' and inserting ``Unless otherwise determined under paragraph (3)(C), funding''; and (ii) by striking ``one third'' and inserting ``50 percent''.

Summary:", Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to reduce the matching funds requirement for participants in the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program from not less than 50 of the costs incurred for the first three years and an increasing share for each of the last three years to no more than 50 of the costs incurred by a participating Regional Center for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish criteria to determine a Center's cost share. [end]

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Year 2000 Information Disclosure Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following: (1) Thousands of computer systems, software, and semiconductors are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year 2000 and thereafter as if they represent the year 1900 or thereafter. This could cripple systems that are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, consumer products, utilities, government, and safety systems in the United States and throughout the world. Reprogramming or replacing affected systems before this problem cripples essential systems is a matter of national and global interest. (2) The prompt and thorough disclosure and exchange of information related to Year 2000 readiness of entities, products, and services would greatly enhance the ability of public and private entities to improve their Year 2000 readiness and, thus, is a matter of national importance and a vital factor in minimizing disruption to the Nation's economic well-being. (3) Concern about the potential for legal liability associated with the disclosure and exchange of Year 2000 compliance information is impeding the disclosure and exchange of such information. (4) The capability to freely disseminate and exchange information relating to Year 2000 readiness with the public and with other companies without undue concern about litigation is critical to the ability of public and private entities to address Year 2000 needs in a timely manner. (5) The national interest will be served by uniform legal standards in connection with the disclosure and exchange of Year 2000 readiness information that will promote disclosures and exchanges of such information in a timely fashion. (b) Purposes.--Based upon the powers contained in Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution, the purposes of this Act are to promote the free disclosure and exchange of information related to Year 2000 readiness and to lessen burdens on interstate commerce by establishing certain uniform legal principles in connection with the disclosure and exchange of information related to Year 2000 readiness. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Act, the following definitions apply: (1) Year 2000 statement.--The term ``Year 2000 statement'' means any statement-- (A) concerning an assessment, projection, or estimate concerning Year 2000 processing capabilities of any entity or entities, product, or service, or a set of products or services; (B) concerning plans, objectives, or timetables for implementing or verifying the Year 2000 processing capabilities of an entity or entities, a product, or service, or a set of products or services; or (C) concerning test plans, test dates, test results, or operational problems or solutions related to Year 2000 processing by-- (i) products; or (ii) services that incorporate or utilize products.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Cell Phone Users Bill of Rights''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Consumers rely increasingly on wireless telephone service for personal, business, and emergency communications. There are currently more than 137,000,000 wireless telephone users in the United States. This is more than a 121 percent increase in the number of such users in the past five years alone. In the future this number is projected to grow as consumers switch from wireline to wireless telephone service for their primary telephone service. (2) The lack of wireless telephone number portability--the capacity of a consumer to retain a wireless telephone number when changing wireless telephone service providers--is a barrier to competition in the market for wireless telephone service. The lack of number portability acts as a disincentive for wireless telephone service providers to improve the quality of their wireless telephone service. (3) The lack of wireless telephone number portability imposes significant costs on individual consumers and businesses looking to change wireless telephone service providers. More than half of business wireless telephone users report that number portability would make them more likely to change wireless telephone service providers. (4) Consumers cannot easily compare offers for wireless telephone service because information on terms, pricing, and service plans for such service is not presented in a uniform manner. Current wireless telephone service contracts do not clearly display the information consumers need to make an informed choice regarding a wireless telephone service contract. Consumers may not be aware of the deficiencies in wireless telephone service quality until after they have signed a contract, and exorbitant early termination penalties effectively lock consumers into undesired, long-term contracts. (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are-- (1) to improve quality of wireless telephone service; and (2) to promote consumer choice in the wireless telephone service market. SEC. 3. TELEPHONE NUMBER PORTABILITY FOR WIRELESS TELEPHONE SERVICE. (a) Requirement in Largest Markets.-- (1) Requirement.--Commencing not later than six months after the date of the enactment of this Act, or November 24, 2003, whichever is earlier, the Federal Communications Commission shall require each wireless telephone service provider offering service in one of the 100 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA), as defined by the Bureau of the Census, to provide consumers with the option to port telephone numbers between wireless telephone service providers by implementing wireless telephone number portability throughout the networks of wireless telephone service providers in each of such 100 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas. (2) Requirement not dependent on other carrier request.-- The requirement in paragraph (1) shall be implemented in each Metropolitan Statistical Area referred to in that paragraph without regard to the receipt of a request from any telecommunications carrier in such Metropolitan Statistical Area for wireless telephone number portability. (b) Other Markets.-- (1) Requirement.--Commencing not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, or November 24, 2004, whichever is earlier, the Commission shall require each wireless telephone service provider in a Metropolitan Statistical Area described in paragraph (2) to provide customers with the option to port their telephone number between wireless telephone service providers by implementing wireless telephone number portability throughout the networks of wireless telephone service providers in such Metropolitan Statistical Area. (2) Covered metropolitan statistical areas.--A Metropolitan Statistical Area described in this paragraph is a Metropolitan Statistical Area not covered by subsection (a) in which three or more wireless telephone services providers provide wireless telephone service. SEC. 4. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR PLANS AND CONTRACTS FOR WIRELESS TELEPHONE SERVICE. (a) Disclosure Requirements.--The Federal Communications Commission shall require that any publication, including publication on the Internet, of a wireless telephone service provider of the terms of a plan or contract for wireless telephone service shall set forth, in a plain and conspicuous manner, the following information: (1) Charges.--Information on charges, including calling- from area, monthly base charge, per-minute charges for minutes not included in the plan, and the method of calculating minutes charged. (2) Minutes.--Information on minutes included in plan, including weekday/daytime, nights/weekends, long-distance, roaming, incoming, and directory assistance. (3) Contract terms.--Information on plan or contract terms, including length of contract, early or other termination fees, trial periods, and start-up fees. (4) Taxes and surcharges.-- (A) Taxes.--Information on taxes to be collected by the carrier for, and paid to, a State, local, or other governmental agency. (B) Surcharges.--Information on surcharges imposed by the carrier for the costs of compliance with regulations or for other purposes. (5) Other information.--Any other information that the Commission considers appropriate to ensure that consumers of wireless telephone service are fully informed of the terms of the plan or contract. (b) Format.--Not later than six months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall prescribe regulations requiring that the information required by subsection (a) be published by wireless telephone service providers in a tabular format, in a clear and uniform manner, and in at least 10 point font. SEC. 5. PROVISION OF INFORMATION ON WIRELESS TELEPHONE SERVICE COVERAGE AND QUALITY TO CONSUMERS. (a) Service Area Maps.-- (1) Requirement.--Each wireless telephone service provider shall make available a map showing the wireless telephone service area of such provider. Each such map shall contain the maximum practicable level of granularity. Each such map shall be updated not less often than quarterly. (2) Times of provision.--A map of the service area of a wireless telephone service shall be provided to a consumer-- (A) upon the request of the consumer; (B) whenever a plan or contract for the service is entered into; and (C) at such other times as the Federal Communications Commission shall provide. (3) Electronic availability.--Each map of a service area under paragraph (1) shall be available-- (A) on the Internet web site of the provider concerned; and (B) on the Internet web site of the Commission. (b) Service Quality.-- (1) Monitoring.--The Commission shall monitor the quality of wireless telephone service provided in the United States by requiring semiannual reports by wireless telephone service providers on the following: (A) Dropped calls. (B) Blocked calls. (C) Known coverage gaps (including average signal strength) or dead zones. (D) Predicted street level signal strength. (E) Any other matters the Commission considers appropriate. (2) Communication with public.--In monitoring the quality of wireless telephone service under paragraph (1), the Commission shall establish a toll-free telephone number (commonly referred to as an ``800'' number) and an Internet web site at which members of the public can submit to the Commission their comments and views on the quality of such service. (3) Publication.--The Commission shall make available to wireless telephone service providers and the public on a semiannual basis information on the quality of wireless telephone service provided in the United States. SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT. (a) Enforcement by FCC.-- (1) In general.--The Federal Communications Commission shall have the power and authority to enforce the provisions of this Act as if such provisions were provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.). (2) Penalties.--Penalties authorized by title V of the Communications Act of 1947 (47 U.S.C. 501 et seq.) may be imposed under this subsection for a violation of a provision of this Act. (b) Enforcement by States.-- (1) Authority.--The attorney general of a State, or the public utility commission of a State if authorized by the laws of the State, may bring a civil action on behalf of the residents of the State in a district court of the United States of appropriate jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this Act. (2) Penalties.--Penalties authorized by title V of the Communications Act of 1934 for a violation of a provision of that Act may be imposed in a civil action under this subsection for a violation of a provision of this Act. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. In this Act: (1) Wireless telephone service.--The term ``wireless telephone service'' means any form of wireless telephone service, including cellular telephone service, broadband Personal Communication Service (PCS) telephone service, Covered Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) service, and any successor service to such service (including so-called next generation or third generations service).

Summary:"," Cell Phone Users Bill of Rights - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to require each wireless telephone service provider (provider) offering service in one of the largest 100 US metropolitan statistical areas to provide consumers with the option to port (retain) telephone numbers between providers by implementing wireless telephone number portability throughout the networks of providers in each of those statistical areas.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; TABLE OF CONTENTS. (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2015''. (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) In 2014, registered nurses ranked sixth among all occupations for the number of cases of musculoskeletal disorders resulting in days away from work, with 11,360 total cases. Nursing assistants reported 20,020 cases in 2014, the second highest of any profession. The leading cause of these health care employees' injuries is patient lifting, transferring, and repositioning injuries, which constitute a significant risk to the health and welfare of those employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. (2) The physical demands of the nursing profession lead many nurses to leave the profession. Fifty-two percent of nurses complain of chronic back pain and 38 percent suffer from pain severe enough to require leave from work. Many nurses and other health care workers suffering back injury do not return to work. These consequences constitute a material impairment of health for these employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. (3) Patients are not at optimum levels of safety while being lifted, transferred, or repositioned manually. Appropriate mechanical lifts can substantially reduce skin tears and pressure ulcers suffered by patients and the frequency of patients being dropped, thus allowing patients a safer means to progress through their care and avoid disabling injuries due to unsafe practices. (4) The development of assistive patient handling technology, equipment, and devices has essentially rendered the act of strict manual patient handling outdated and typically unnecessary as a function of nursing care. (5) A growing number of health care facilities that have incorporated patient handling technology and practices have reported positive results. Injuries among nursing staff and health care workers have dramatically declined at health care facilities implementing safe patient handling technology, equipment, devices, and practices. As a result, the number of lost work days due to injury and staff turnover has declined. Studies have also shown that assistive patient handling technology successfully reduces workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders. (6) A number of States have implemented safe patient handling, mobility and injury prevention standards. The success of these programs at the facility and State level demonstrates the technological and economical feasibility of such standards. (7) Establishing a safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard for direct-care registered nurses and other health care workers is a critical component reasonably necessary for protecting the health and safety of nurses and other health care workers, addressing the nursing shortage, and increasing patient safety. (c) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as follows: Sec. 1. Short title; findings; table of contents. Sec. 2. Safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard. Sec. 3. Application of safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard to facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. Sec. 4. Nonpreemption. Sec. 5. Definitions. SEC. 2. SAFE PATIENT HANDLING, MOBILITY, AND INJURY PREVENTION STANDARD. (a) Rulemaking.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall, pursuant to section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655), promulgate an interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention (in this section such standard is referred to as the ``safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard'') to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for direct-care registered nurses and all other health care workers handling patients. The interim final standard shall remain in effect until it is replaced by a final safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard. (b) Requirements.--The safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard shall require the use of engineering and safety controls to perform handling of patients and to reduce the incidence of injuries from manual handling of patients by direct-care registered nurses and all other health care workers, through the development of a comprehensive program, to include the use of mechanical technology and devices to the greatest degree feasible. Where the use of mechanical technology and devices is not feasible, the standards shall require the use of alternative controls and measures to minimize the risk of injury to nurses and health care workers resulting from the manual handling of patients. The standard shall apply to all health care employers, shall generally align with interprofessional national safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards, and shall include the following: (1) Program development.--A requirement that each health care employer shall develop and implement a safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program within 6 months of the date of promulgation of the interim final standard, which program shall include hazard identification, risk assessments, and control measures in relation to patient care duties and patient handling. (2) Technology and equipment purchase and management.--A requirement that, within 2 years of the date of issuance by the Secretary of an interim final standard, each health care employer shall purchase, use, maintain, and make accessible to health care workers, such safe patient handling equipment, technology, and accessories as the Secretary determines appropriate. (3) Health care worker participation.--A requirement that each health care employer shall obtain input from health care workers, to include direct care registered nurses, health care workers, their representatives, and their collective bargaining agents, in developing and implementing the safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program, including training and education and the purchase of technology and equipment and necessary accessories. (4) Data tracking and review.--A requirement that each health care employer shall establish a review program to analyze data relevant to the implementation of the employers' safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program, and shall account for circumstances where safe patient handling technology or equipment were not utilized in accordance with the health care employers' safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard. Each health care employer shall upon request, make available their findings and data used in such review, to health care workers, their representatives, their collective bargaining agents, and the Secretary or other Federal agency. Each health care employer shall maintain the data and findings from their review for at least 5 years (5) Incorporation of technology into facilities.--A requirement that each health care employer shall consider the feasibility of incorporating safe patient handling technology as part of process of new facility design and construction, or facility remodeling. (6) Education and training.--A requirement that each health care employer shall train health care workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, technology, equipment, and devices, initially, and on a continuing annual basis, and as necessary. Such training shall prepare health care workers, to identify, assess, and control musculoskeletal hazards of a general nature, and those specific to particular patient care areas, and shall be conducted by an individual with knowledge in the subject matter, and delivered, at least in part, in an interactive simulated point-of-care training and hands-on format that reflects the specific demands of a health care workers' duties. (7) Notice of safe patient handling and rights under this act.--A requirement that each health care employer shall post a uniform notice in a form specified by the Secretary that-- (A) explains the safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard; (B) includes information regarding safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies and training; (C) explains procedures to report patient handling- related injuries; and (D) explains health care workers' rights under this Act, including any whistleblower protections. (8) Annual evaluation.--A requirement that each health care employer shall conduct an annual written evaluation of the implementation of the safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program, including handling procedures, selection of technology, equipment, and engineering controls, assessment of injuries, and new safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention technology and devices that have been developed. The evaluation shall be conducted with the involvement of nurses, other health care workers, their representatives, and their collective bargaining agents, and their input shall be documented in the evaluation. Health care employers shall take corrective action as recommended in the written evaluation. (9) Right to refuse unsafe assignment.--A requirement that each health care employer shall provide procedures under which a health care worker or employee may refuse to perform the employee's duties if the employee has a reasonable apprehension that performing such duties would violate the safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard, and would result in injury or impairment of health to the health care worker, other health care workers, or patients. Where practicable, the health care worker must have communicated the health or safety concern to the health care employer and have not been able to obtain a correction of the violation. (c) Inspections.--The Secretary of Labor shall conduct unscheduled inspections under section 8 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 657) to ensure implementation of and compliance with the safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard. SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF SAFE PATIENT HANDLING, MOBILITY, AND INJURY PREVENTION STANDARD TO FACILITIES RECEIVING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FUNDS. (a) In General.--Section 1866 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395cc) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)(1)(V), by inserting ``and safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard (as initially promulgated under section 2 of the Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2015)'' before the period at the end; and (2) in subsection (b)(4)-- (A) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``and the safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard'' after ``Bloodborne Pathogens standard''; and (B) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``or the safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard'' after ``Bloodborne Pathogens standard''.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Parental Right to Decide Protection Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) HPV, the human papillomavirus, is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. HPV types 16 and 18 cause about 70 percent of cervical cancers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 6,200,000 Americans become infected with HPV each year and that over half of all sexually active men and women become infected at some time in their lives. On average, there are 9,710 new cases of cervical cancer and 3,700 deaths attributed to it in the United States each year. (2) Early detection is the key to diagnosing and curing cervical cancer, and therefore the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that all women get regular Pap tests. The Pap test looks for cell changes caused by HPV, so the cervix can be treated before the cells turn into cancer. The FDA also states the Pap test can also find cancer in its early stages so it can be treated before it becomes too serious, and reaches the conclusion that it is rare to die from cervical cancer if the disease is caught early. (3) On June 8, 2006, the FDA approved Gardasil, the first vaccine developed to prevent cervical cancer, precancerous genital lesions, and genital warts due to human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18. Gardasil is a recombinant vaccine, it does not contain a live virus, and it is given as three injections over a six-month period. The vaccine is approved for use in females 9-26 years of age. However, the FDA also states that since the vaccine is new, more studies need to be done to determine how long women will be protected from HPV. For example, the FDA does not know if a booster is needed after a couple of years to ensure continuity of protection. (4) As detailed by the FDA, four studies were conducted in 21,000 women, one in the United States and three multinational, to show how well Gardasil worked in women between the ages of 16 and 26. The study period was not long enough for cervical cancer to develop; however, preventing cervical precancerous lesions is believed highly likely to result in the prevention of cervical cancer. (5) In January 2007 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, issued changes to the previous childhood and adolescent immunization schedule. The ACIP recommends the new human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) to be administered in a 3- dose schedule with the second and third doses administered 2 and 6 months after the first dose. Routine vaccination with HPV is recommended for females aged 11-12 years, the vaccination series can be started in females as young as age 9 years, and a catch up vaccination is recommended for females aged 13-26 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the full vaccine series. (6) In July 2008 Judicial Watch, a Washington-based public interest group, reported that there have been close to 9,000 health complaints as a result of Gardasil. These complaints have surfaced because Gardasil recipients have experienced everything from massive wart outbreaks to paralysis, and even death in 18 cases. (7) States historically have maintained the practice of applying immunization recommendations to their school admittance policies so as to protect schoolchildren from outbreaks of contagious disease. The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons states that there is no public health purpose for mandating HPV vaccine for schoolchildren. HPV is a sexually transmitted disease. (8) With a number of states entertaining legislation which takes the unprecedented step in requiring young girls to obtain a vaccine for a disease that is not spread by casual contact in order to attend school, many organizations and associations have come out against mandatory HPV vaccine programs. (9) The American College of Pediatricians and the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons are opposed to any legislation which would require HPV vaccination for school attendance. They have stated that excluding children from school for refusal to be vaccinated for a disease spread only by intercourse is a serious, precedent-setting action that trespasses on the right of parents to make medical decisions for their children as well as on the rights of the children to attend school. (10) Federal funds should not be used to implement a mandatory vaccine program for a disease that does not threaten the public health of schoolchildren in the course of casual, daily interaction between classmates and inserts the government into the lives of children, parents, and physicians. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION AGAINST FUNDING FOR MANDATORY HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) VACCINATION PROGRAMS. No Federal funds or other assistance may be made available to any State or political subdivision of a State to establish or implement any requirement that individuals receive vaccination for human papillomavirus (HPV).

Congress finds that-- (1) although the United States Customs Service has collected increased duties, merchandise fees, and revenues from other commerce-related activities because of the approval and implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, these increased revenues have not been accompanied by Federal funding for improving transportation facilities along the international borders of the United States to ensure the free and safe flow of trade destined for all States and regions of the United States; (2) because of NAFTA, all 4 States along the United States- Mexico border will require significant investments in highway infrastructure capacity and motor carrier safety enforcement at a time when border States face extreme difficulty in meeting current highway funding needs; (3) the full benefits of increased international trade can be realized only if delays at the borders are significantly reduced; and (4) the increased revenues to the general fund of the Treasury described in paragraph (1) should be sufficient to provide Federal funding for transportation improvements required to accommodate NAFTA-generated traffic, in an amount above and beyond regular Federal transportation funding apportionments. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the following definitions apply: (1) Border region.--The term ``border region'' means the region located within 60 miles of the United States border with Mexico. (2) Border state.--The term ``border State'' means California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. (3) Fund.--The term ``Fund'' means the Border Transportation Infrastructure Fund established under section 4(g). (4) NAFTA.--The term ``NAFTA'' means the North American Free Trade Agreement. (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Transportation. SEC. 4. DIRECT FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR BORDER CONSTRUCTION AND CONGESTION RELIEF.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2011'' or the ``STANDUP Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has reported that-- (A) motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death of Americans between 15 and 20 years of age; (B) between 1999 and 2009, more than 90,000 Americans were killed in motor vehicle crashes involving drivers between 15 and 20 years of age, an average of 155 deaths per week; (C) drivers between 16 and 20 years of age have a fatality rate that is 4 times higher than the rate for drivers between 25 and 70 years of age; and (D) teenage drivers who are 16 years of age have a motor vehicle crash rate that is almost 10 times higher than the crash rate for drivers between 30 and 60 years of age. (2) The National Transportation Safety Board found that during the most recent 10-year period-- (A) teen drivers comprised less than 7 percent of the driving population and accounted for more than 13 percent of drivers involved in all deadly crashes; and (B) more than 20 percent of all highway fatalities occurred in crashes that involved teen drivers. (3) Analysis by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute shows that-- (A) teenage drivers comprise approximately 40 percent of the fatalities in motor vehicle crashes in which they are involved; and (B) the other 60 percent of the fatalities in those crashes are-- (i) passengers who were riding in the vehicle with the teen driver; (ii) drivers and passengers in other vehicles involved in a crash with the teen driver's vehicle; and (iii) pedestrians. (4) According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety-- (A) the chance that a vehicle driven by a 16- or 17-year-old will be involved in an accident-- (i) doubles when there are 2 other teens in the vehicle; and (ii) quadruples when there are 4 teens in the vehicle; (B) States with strong nighttime driving restrictions experience lower fatal crash rates among drivers ages 15 to 17 years old; and (C) a higher age requirement for licensing teen drivers is correlated with a lower number of fatal crashes per capita. (5) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has found that distraction caused by cellular phones is significant enough to degrade driver performance, and is particularly dangerous for inexperienced drivers between 15 and 20 years of age. (6) That National Transportation Safety Board has found that although only 20 percent of driving by teenage drivers occurs at night, more than 50 percent of the motor vehicle crash fatalities involving teenage drivers occur at night. (7) According to a 2007 report from the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University-- (A) teenage drivers in rural areas are less likely to be aware of the risks and dangers associated with driving, placing them at higher risk of involvement in crashes; (B) teen drivers are more likely than other drivers-- (i) to drive with other teenage passengers; (ii) to drive late at night; (iii) to exceed the speed limit; (iv) to use cell phones while driving; and (v) to fail to use seat belts while driving. (8) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that although 23 percent of the population of the United States lives in rural areas, 57 percent of all traffic fatalities occur on rural roads, underscoring the elevated crash risk for teen drivers in rural areas. (9) The American Academy of Pediatrics has found evidence that the area of the brain responsible for planning, impulse control, and executive decisionmaking does not fully mature until a person is between 20 and 25 years of age, placing teen drivers at greater risk of being involved in an accident. (10) The Journal of the American Medical Association reports that after Michigan and North Carolina adopted comprehensive graduated driver licensing systems in 1997, crashes involving 16-year-old drivers decreased by 25 percent in Michigan and by 27 percent in North Carolina. (11) According to the Office of the Illinois Secretary of State, teen driving deaths dropped by over 40 percent in Illinois in the first full year following the 2007 implementation of a stronger graduated driver licensing law. (12) The National Transportation Safety Board reports that over 40 States and the District of Columbia have implemented some type of 3-stage graduated driver licensing system. However, most States have not yet enacted all of the lifesaving safety features of graduated driver licensing laws recommended by the National Transportation Safety Board and supported by research to protect the lives of teenage and novice drivers. (13) A 2010 national survey by the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety indicates that-- (A) parents of teens favor graduated driver licensing laws that are as strict or stricter than those that currently exist in any State; (B) \2/3\ of parents of teens believe that young drivers should begin learning to drive at 16 years of age or older; (C) more than \1/2\ of parents of teens believe that the minimum licensing age should be 17 years of age or older; (D) 90 percent of parents of teens support a restriction on unsupervised nighttime driving; (E) more than 75 percent of parents of teens believe that the restriction on unsupervised nighttime driving should begin at 10 p.m. or earlier; (F) 89 percent of parents of teens support restrictions on teen passengers; and (G) more than 75 percent of parents of teens believe that teen drivers should not be permitted to more than 1 teen passenger in their vehicle. SEC. 3. STATE GRADUATED DRIVER LICENSING LAWS. (a) Minimum Requirements.-- (1) In general.--A State is in compliance with this section if the State has a graduated driver licensing law that requires novice drivers younger than 21 years of age to comply with the 2-stage licensing process described in paragraph (2) before receiving an unrestricted driver's license.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``FDA Scientific Fairness for Women Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) With respect to the Office of Women's Health within the Food and Drug Administration: (A) When first established, the Office reported directly to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. (B) In the current organization of the Food and Drug Administration (``FDA''), the Office of Women's Health is located at the second level reporting within the Office of the Commissioner and is within the Office of Science and Health Coordination. (2) With respect to the regulation by the FDA of silicone breast implants: (A) In a draft guidance issued in January 2004, the FDA asked manufacturers of such implants-- (i) to describe the rates of implant rupture over the lifetime of the product; (ii) to describe the incidence of gel migration resulting from ruptures; and (iii) to characterize the health consequences of ruptures and associated migration. (B) The manufacturers of silicone breast implants have not complied with that draft guidance for the specific implants in their premarket-approval applications. (C) A study released by FDA researchers in 2000 reviewed silicone breast implants that were an average age of 17 years and concluded that 69 percent of the women had ruptures in one or more silicone breast implants, and 21 percent experienced gel migration outside the implant. Implant manufacturers have not established whether the implants in their premarket- approval applications would have similar or different failure rates and leakage after 17 years. (D) In April 2005, a study published in the American Journal of Surgical Pathology focusing on gel migration found that 90 percent of the women studied who had silicone implants showed silicone droplets in their lymph nodes. The study also showed that 95 percent of these women had abnormal cells in their lymph nodes, compared with only 33 percent of women who had breast cancer surgery without the addition of silicone implants. (E) In 2003, the U.S. government entered into a settlement with breast implant manufacturers for reimbursement for medical expenses paid by the Federal Government for women harmed by silicone gel breast implants. (F) FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations (``OCI'') has investigated whether one manufacturer of breast implants submitted inaccurate data on ruptures in its application. The FDA OCI also is investigating allegations regarding whether that same manufacturer failed to ensure that their implants were used in compliance with FDA restrictions for the Adjunct Study. (3) With respect to the applications submitted to the FDA by Barr Laboratories for approval of the contraceptive drug marketed as Plan B: (A) The FDA rejected the first Plan B application in May 2004 because of concerns that easier access to Plan B might result in increased promiscuity among women under 16, despite studies disproving this contention. (B) The FDA said it would not approve the Plan B application unless it included an age-based sales distinction. In response, Barr Laboratories submitted a new application to provide over-the-counter sales of plan B to women 16 years and older. More than one-year later, FDA expressed concern that the age-based sales distinction would present regulatory concerns, even though the amended application was the result of FDA's recommendations. (C) According to court documents released on August 3, 2006, the director of FDA's Office of New Drugs learned early in 2004 that the then-FDA Commissioner had decided against approval of Plan B before FDA staff could complete their analysis. (D) In another sworn deposition contained in the same court documents, one FDA official was told in January 2004 by the FDA Deputy Commissioner that Plan B needed to be rejected to ``appease the administration's constituents''. (E) In a letter and congressional testimony on August 1, the FDA Commissioner recommended that the appropriate age range for over-the-counter Plan B is 18 and older. This recommendation was established arbitrarily and acknowledged by FDA as not supported by scientific data. (F) A former FDA Commissioner testified in a sworn statement that he delayed approving over-the-counter sales of Plan B to determine how to restrict sales to young teens. (G) A study in the Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology concluded that young women are able to use Plan B ``effectively and safely without health care provider intervention''. (H) In November 2005, the Governmental Accountability Office found that the May 2004 decision to deny OTC status to Plan B emergency contraception ``was unusual'' in that the decision was made at a much higher level within FDA than is usual practice, that the decision overruled recommendations by several levels of professional staff, and that the decision to limit OTC access to only those over a certain age was made prior to the completion of the regular review process. SEC. 3. OFFICE OF WOMEN'S HEALTH WITHIN FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. Section 903 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 392) is amended-- (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections (g) and (h), respectively; (2) in subsection (g) (as so redesignated), in paragraph (1), by striking ``subsection (f)'' and inserting ``subsection (g)''; and (3) by inserting after subsection (e) the following subsection: ``(f) Office of Women's Health.-- ``(1) In general.--There is established within the Office of the Commissioner an office to be known as the Office of Women's Health (referred to in this subsection as the `Office'). The Office shall be headed by a director, who shall report directly to the Commissioner. ``(2) Duties.--With respect to activities of the Food and Drug Administration that relate to women's health, the Director of the Office shall-- ``(A) assess the level of agency activity; ``(B) set short-range and long-range goals; and ``(C) be responsible for activities related to prevention, research, education and training, service delivery, and policy development.''.

The notice shall include a summary of the professional and educational background of the individual. ``(3) The individual may not serve at any meeting of the committee until 30 days after the notice is posted on such site. ``(e) Study on the Ionization of Platinum.--The Secretary shall provide for a study on the ionization and levels of platinum in silicone breast implants, analyzing the platinum found in silicone gel breast implants in vivo as well as levels and ionization found in the women's tissues, breast milk, and other bodily fluids. The study shall also report the potential short-term and long-term risks of the presence of platinum or platinum salts. The Secretary shall establish a panel of independent scientists, including scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, for the purpose of designing and conducting the study. ``(f) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term `breast implant' means a device intended to be implanted to augment or reconstruct the female breast that contains a filler material comprised of a substance or substances other than sterile isotonic saline.''. SEC. 5. SCIENTIFIC WORKSHOP ON USE OF EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION BY WOMEN UNDER AGE 18. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall convene a scientific workshop within six months after the date of the enactment of this Act to review and evaluate current scientific data on the use of emergency contraception by females of childbearing potential under the age of 18. The scientific workshop shall-- (1) address the scientific questions identified in the recent limited approval of Plan B emergency contraception; and (2) include among the participants in the workshop-- (A) scientific and clinical representatives from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Adolescent Medicine, the American Medical Association, the National Institutes of Health, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; (B) scientific and clinical researchers who have carried out research on use of contraceptives, including emergency contraceptives, by women under the age of 18; and (C) the appropriate review divisions of the Food and Drug Administration and the professional scientific and clinical staff within such divisions.

Summary:"," FDA Scientific Fairness for Women Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to establish the Office of Women's Health within the Office of the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from finding that a reasonable assurance of safety has been shown for an application for premarket approval for a class III device for a breast implant unless the applicant involved has established the lifetime of the implant and demonstrates that safety has been demonstrated for the life of the implant. Requires the Secretary to determine appropriate clinical care and removal and replacement requirements for the implant, including appropriate coverage by government health care systems.

Summary:"," Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011 - Amends the Clean Air Act to prohibit the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from promulgating any regulation concerning, taking action relating to, or taking into consideration the emission of a greenhouse gas (GHG) to address climate change. Excludes GHGs from the definition of air pollutant for purposes of addressing climate change. Exempts from such prohibition: (1) implementation and enforcement of the rule, Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards and finalization, implementation, enforcement, and revision of the proposed rule, Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles, (2) implementation of the renewable fuel program. (3) statutorily authorized federal research, development, and demonstration programs and voluntary programs addressing climate change. (4) implementation and enforcement of stratospheric ozone protection to the extent that such implementation or enforcement only involves class I or II substances. And (5) implementation and enforcement of requirements for monitoring and reporting of carbon dioxide emissions. Provides that none of such exemptions shall cause a GHG to be subject to regulations relating to prevention of significant deterioration of air quality or considered an air pollutant for purposes of air pollution prevention and control permits. Repeals and makes ineffective the following rules and actions: Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act Reconsideration of Interpretation of Regulations That Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs and the memorandum, EPA's Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Federal Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Permit Program Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule Action To Ensure Authority To Issue Permits Under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program to Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Finding of Substantial Inadequacy and SIP Call Action To Ensure Authority To Issue Permits Under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program to Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Finding of Failure To Submit State Implementation Plan Revisions Required for Greenhouse Gases Action to Ensure Authority To Issue Permits Under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program to Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Federal Implementation Plan Action to Ensure Authority to Implement Title V Permitting Programs Under the Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule Determinations Concerning Need for Error Correction, Partial Approval and Partial Disapproval, and Federal Implementation Plan Regarding Texas Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program Limitation of Approval of Prevention of Significant Deterioration Provisions Concerning Greenhouse Gas Emitting-Sources in State Implementation Plans Determinations Concerning Need for Error Correction, Partial Approval and Partial Disapproval, and Federal Implementation Plan Regarding Texas Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program. Proposed Rule Any other federal action under such Act occurring before this Act's enactment that applies a stationary source permitting requirement or an emissions standard for a GHG to address climate change Prohibits the Administrator from waiving, and invalidates waivers given by the Administrator before the enactment of this Act, the ban on states from adopting or enforcing standards relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or engines with respect to GHG emissions for model year 2017 or any subsequent model year. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) there is established scientific concern over warming of the climate system. (2) addressing climate change is an international issue, involving complex scientific and economic considerations. And (3) the United States has a role to play in resolving global climate change matters on an international basis. Urges Congress to fulfill such role by developing policies that do not adversely affect the American economy, energy supplies, and employment. [end] "

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Accounting for Methane in Production through Loophole Elimination with Oil and Gas Royalties'' or the ``AMPLE Oil and Gas Royalties Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) Some of the mineral resources owned by the Federal Government on behalf of United States taxpayers are being developed inefficiently, costing taxpayers millions of dollars in lost royalties, especially with respect to vented, flared, and leaked natural gas. The Government Accountability Office estimates that approximately 40 percent of natural gas could be economically captured from Federal onshore leases, which would increase Federal royalty payments by approximately $23,000,000 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to up to 16.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to annual emissions from 3.1 million cars. (2) Significant emissions of natural gas are associated with oil and gas production and transportation, including oil and gas produced on Federal lands. According to a University of Maryland study, these emissions can negatively impact air quality hundreds of miles away. (3) Methane has a much greater impact on climate change than carbon dioxide, and the methane emissions from oil and gas production can greatly diminish the benefit of using natural gas to help reduce the carbon intensity of the United States fuel mix. (4) Available control technologies exist to economically capture a considerable amount of natural gas and resulting in taxpayers being delivered the royalties they deserve. (5) Requiring royalty payments on natural gas that is currently flared, vented, unavoidably lost, and used for beneficial purposes will lead to more efficient use of Federal resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase royalty payments to the Federal Government. SEC. 3. VOLUME ALLOCATION OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION. (a) In General.--Section 111(k) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (30 U.S.C. 1721(k)) is amended to read as follows: ``(k) Volume Allocation of Oil and Gas Production.-- ``(1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided by this subsection-- ``(A) a lessee or its designee of a lease in a unit or communitization agreement that contains only Federal leases with the same royalty rate and funds distribution shall report and pay royalties on oil and gas production for each production month based on the actual volume of oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir by or on behalf of that lessee, including all oil and gas not sold by or on behalf of that lessee; ``(B) a lessee or its designee of a lease in any other unit or communitization agreement shall report and pay royalties on oil and gas production for each production month based on the volume of oil and gas produced from such agreement and allocated to the lease in accordance with the terms of the agreement; and ``(C) a lessee or its designee of a lease that is not contained in a unit or communitization agreement shall report and pay royalties on oil and gas production for each production month based on the actual volume of oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir by or on behalf of that lessee, including all oil and gas not sold by or on behalf of that lessee. ``(2) Definition.--In this subsection the term `oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir' means any oil and gas that is produced, sold, vented, flared, used for beneficial purposes, leaked, or otherwise emitted during production.''. (b) Conforming Amendments.--The Mineral Leasing Act is amended-- (1) in section 17(b)(1)(A) (30 U.S.C. 226(b)(1)(A)), by striking ``the production removed or sold from the lease'' and inserting ``oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir in accordance with section 111(k) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982''; (2) in section 17(c)(1) (30 U.S.C. 226(c)(1)), by striking ``the production removed or sold from the lease'' and inserting ``oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir in accordance with section 111(k) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982''; (3) in section 31(e)(3) (30 U.S.C. 188(e)(3))-- (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``production per well per day'' and inserting ``oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir per well per day in accordance with section 111(k) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982''; and (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``all production removed or sold from such lease'' and inserting ``all oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir in accordance with section 111(k) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982''; and (4) in section 31(f)(4) (30 U.S.C. 188(f)(4)), by striking ``production removed or sold from the oil placer mining claim'' and inserting ``oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir in accordance with section 111(k) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982''. (c) Application.--This section, including the amendments made by this section, shall not apply with respect to any lease issued before the date of the enactment of this Act.

Summary:"," Accounting for Methane in Production through Loophole Elimination with Oil and Gas Royalties or the AMPLE Oil and Gas Royalties Act This bill amends the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 to require, with respect to federal oil and gas leases, a lessee or its designee of a lease in a unit or communitization agreement that contains only federal leases with the same royalty rate and funds distribution, or a lessee or its designee of a lease that is not contained in a unit or communitization agreement, to report and pay royalties on oil and gas production each month based on the actual volume of oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir by or on behalf of that lessee, including all oil and gas not sold by or on behalf of that lessee. quot, Oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoirquot.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Housing Preservation Matching Grant Act of 2003''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that-- (1) more than 55,300 affordable housing dwelling units in the United States have been lost through termination of low income affordability requirements, which usually involves the prepayment of the outstanding principal balance under the mortgage on the project in which such units are located; (2) more than 265,000 affordable housing dwelling units in the United States are currently at risk of prepayment; (3) the loss of the privately owned, federally assisted affordable housing, which is occurring during a period when rents for unassisted housing are increasing and few units of additional affordable housing are being developed, will cause unacceptable harm on current tenants of affordable housing and will precipitate a national crisis in the supply of housing for low-income households; (4) the demand for affordable housing far exceeds the supply of such housing, as evidenced by studies in 1998 that found that-- (A) 5,300,000 households (one-seventh of all renters in the Nation) have worst-case housing needs; and (B) the number of families with at least one full- time worker and having worst-case housing needs increased from 1991 to 1995 by 265,000 (24 percent) to almost 1,400,000; (5) the shortage of affordable housing in the United States reached a record high in 1995, when the number of low-income households exceeded the number of low-cost rental dwelling units by 4,400,000; (6) between 1990 and 1995, the shortage of affordable housing in the United States increased by 1,000,000 dwelling units, as the supply of low-cost units decreased by 100,000 and the number of low-income renter households increased by 900,000; (7) there are nearly 2 low-income renters in the United States for every low-cost rental dwelling unit; (8) 2 of every 3 low-income renters receive no housing assistance and about 2,000,000 low-income households remain on waiting lists for affordable housing; (9) the shortage of affordable housing dwelling units results in low-income households that are not able to acquire low-cost rental units paying large proportions of their incomes for rent; and (10) in 1995, 82 percent of low-income renter households were paying more than 30 percent of their incomes for rent and utilities. (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act-- (1) to promote the preservation of affordable housing units by providing matching grants to States that have developed and funded programs for the preservation of privately owned housing that is affordable to low-income families and persons and was produced for such purpose with Federal assistance; (2) to minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants who are currently residing in such housing, many of whom are elderly or disabled persons; and (3) to continue the partnerships among the Federal Government, State and local governments, and the private sector in operating and assisting housing that is affordable to low- income Americans.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; AND PURPOSES. (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Measures to Encourage Results in Teaching Act of 1998''. (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) All students deserve to be taught by well-educated, competent, and qualified teachers. (2) More than ever before, education has and will continue to become the ticket not only to economic success but to basic survival. Students will not succeed in meeting the demands of a knowledge-based, 21st century society and economy if the students do not encounter more challenging work in school. For future generations to have the opportunities to achieve success the future generations will need to have an education and a teacher workforce second to none. (3) No other intervention can make the difference that a knowledgeable, skillful teacher can make in the learning process. At the same time, nothing can fully compensate for weak teaching that, despite good intentions, can result from a teacher's lack of opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skill needed to help students master the curriculum. (4) The Federal Government established the Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program in 1985 to ensure that teachers and other educational staff have access to sustained and high-quality professional development. This ongoing development must include the ability to demonstrate and judge the performance of teachers and other instructional staff. (5) States should evaluate their teachers on the basis of demonstrated ability, including tests of subject matter knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill. States should develop a test for their teachers and other instructional staff with respect to the subjects taught by the teachers and staff, and should administer the test every 3 to 5 years. (6) Evaluating and rewarding teachers with a compensation system that supports teachers who become increasingly expert in a subject area, are proficient in meeting the needs of students and schools, and demonstrate high levels of performance measured against professional teaching standards, will encourage teachers to continue to learn needed skills and broaden teachers' expertise, thereby enhancing education for all students. (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows: (1) To provide incentives for States to establish and administer periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs for elementary school and secondary school teachers.

Summary:"," Protect Student Borrowers Act of 2015 This bill amends title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require institutions of higher education (IHEs) participating in the William D.

For any fiscal year in which at least 25 of the IHE's student body is participating in the Direct Loan program, the IHE must remit a risk-sharing payment that declines as the cohort default rate declines. If an IHE develops and implements an approved student loan management plan that includes individualized financial aid counseling for students and strategies to minimize student loan default and delinquency, the Department of Education (ED) must modify the risk-sharing requirements. ED may waive or reduce an IHE's risk-sharing payments in certain other instances. An IHE may not deny admission or financial aid based on a perception that a student may be at risk for defaulting on a Direct Loan. ED may enter into contracts or cooperative agreements for: (1) statewide or institutionally-based programs for the prevention of federal student loan delinquency and default at IHEs that have a high cohort default rate or serve large numbers of students who have a higher risk of defaulting on student loans under title IV, and (2) increasing the number of borrowers who successfully rehabilitate defaulted loans. Risk-sharing payments are to be deposited in a separate account in the Treasury and used as follows: (1) up to 50 for ED to enter into the contracts or cooperative agreements for delinquency and default prevention or rehabilitation, and (2) the remainder to offset any future shortfalls in funding under the Federal Pell Grant program. An IHE's ability to meet its obligation to make risk-sharing payments shall be part of the determination of its eligibility to participate in title IV programs. [end] "

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``FHA Multifamily Housing Emergency Disposition Act of 1993''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that-- (1) the Department of Housing and Urban Development has a large and growing inventory of multifamily housing projects owned by the Department and multifamily housing projects subject to mortgages in foreclosure that are held by the Department; (2) the total number of such housing projects in the inventory of the Department at the beginning of fiscal year 1993 was 444 and is likely to increase to 742 by the end of fiscal year 1998; (3) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has estimated that the Department will lose as much as $11,900,000,000 as a result of mortgage foreclosures on multifamily housing projects insured by the Department, which is equivalent to 25 percent of the value of all mortgages insured under the General Insurance Fund; (4) the Department is not prepared to manage an inventory of multifamily housing projects as large as the inventory expected by the end of fiscal year 1993, resulting in increased holding and disposition costs for such projects; and (5) existing laws would require the attachment of $7,000,000,000 of rental assistance in the form of 15-year contracts under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to eliminate the backlog of multifamily housing projects in the inventory of the Department. (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act, therefore, is-- (1) to declare that an emergency exists with respect to the disposition of multifamily housing projects in the inventory of the Department; (2) to provide for flexibility in disposing of such projects by removing some of the statutory requirements that impede the sale of such projects; (3) to encourage assistance for residents of such projects through means other than rental assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937; and (4) to maintain, to the maximum extent possible, the low- income character of such projects while disposing of such projects in an economical and expeditious manner. SEC. 3. EMERGENCY PROVISIONS. (a) Authority.--During the period in which the property disposition emergency under this Act is in effect pursuant to section 4, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may dispose of any multifamily housing project in accordance with the provisions this Act. (b) Applicability of Section 203 Requirements.--The provisions of section 203 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 shall apply to the disposition of multifamily housing projects under this Act, except to the extent that-- (1) any such provision is waived pursuant to section 5 of this Act; or (2) any such provision is inconsistent with any provision of this Act, and then only to the extent of such inconsistency. The Secretary may determine whether inconsistencies referred to in paragraph (2) exist. (c) Requirements.--In disposing of any subsidized or formerly subsidized multifamily housing project under this Act, the Secretary shall, to the extent that budget authority is available-- (1) enter into-- (A) a nonrenewable contract under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 having a term of not less than 60 months and not more than 180 months that provides project-based assistance for units in the project; or (B) annual contributions contracts with the appropriate public housing agency to provide tenant- based rental assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for a total term, including renewals, of not more than 180 months; and (2) provide the assistance under paragraph (1) on behalf of all of the very low-income families occupying the project on the date the project is sold by the Secretary (or such other prior date as the Secretary may determine appropriate), except that the Secretary may in addition provide such assistance to other eligible low-income families occupying such a project on such date if the Secretary determines that such assistance is appropriate under market conditions in the area in which the project is located. (d) Alternative Requirements.--In lieu of, or in addition to, the actions required under subsection (c), the Secretary shall-- (1) seek to ensure, through means other than assistance under such section 8, that rent charges for units in the project remain affordable (as such term is defined by the Secretary) for a reasonable period of time determined by the Secretary; (2) encourage the provision of assistance from non-Federal sources to maintain the affordability of rent charges for units in the project; and (3) encourage the sale of the project to a local nonprofit organization. (e) Unsubsidized Projects.--In connection with the disposition under this Act of a multifamily housing project that is not a subsidized or formerly subsidized project, the Secretary is not required to provide assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, but the Secretary may take any of the actions specified in subsection (d). (f) Additional Assistance.--In order to facilitate the disposition of a multifamily housing project under this Act, the Secretary may provide project-based assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 with respect to units for which such assistance is not required by this Act. (g) Nonrental Uses of Projects.--In disposing of any multifamily housing project under this Act, the Secretary may make the project or units in project available-- (1) for uses related to low-income housing other than rental or cooperative use, such as low-income homeownership opportunities, shelters for the homeless, and office space for resident or housing-related social services providers; and (2) for any other use, if the Secretary, in consultation with the local area-wide governing body, determines that such use will assist efforts to reduce the geographic concentration of low-income housing opportunities. SEC. 4. DURATION OF EMERGENCY. A property disposition emergency under this Act shall be in effect during the period that-- (1) begins upon the enactment of this Act; and (2) ends upon the conclusion of the third fiscal year that begins after the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. WAIVER OF DISPOSITION PLAN REQUIREMENTS. The Secretary may waive any of the provisions of section 203(e) of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 with respect to the disposition of any multifamily housing project under this Act, as the Secretary determines appropriate to expedite such disposition of multifamily housing projects. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Law Enforcement Abuse Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) American law enforcement has a fundamental duty to provide compassion, aid, and protection and safety to the people it serves. (2) A primary function of law enforcement is to preserve life, regardless of the race, ethnicity, religion, social or economic standing, sexual preference, or country of origin of the individuals involved. (3) Over many years, thousands of cases of State and local law enforcement agency violations of suspects, detainees, and prisoners went inadequately addressed across the United States, especially in African-American communities and other communities of color or poverty. (4) In recent years, procedures, training, and public oversight have failed to significantly curb or eliminate abuses and murders of innocent suspects and citizens at the hands of officers of the law, to fully investigate claims of excessive use of force, or to adequately reprimand, punish, or remove such offenders or their superiors. (5) A special prosecutor in Chicago has been investigating a police abuse ring that operated over three decades with impunity, responsible for torturing over 200 African-American males in their custody at the Area 2 and Area 3 police headquarters. (6) Since the 1997 New York Police Department torture of Abner Louima, and the fatal shooting of Amadou Bailo Diallo in 1999, public and media attention concerning abuse of power and the unjustified and improper use of force by law enforcement in communities of color has continuously increased, as have the number of outraged community responses and the demands for external oversight of police practices. (7) More recently, police in Chicago on November 25, 2006, police officers in New York City shot 50 times and killed an unarmed man, Sean Bell. The next day, a community rally protested the police action and called for the removal of Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. (8) Fatal shootings and abuse of suspects and prisoners have come to light again recently in other cities, including Atlanta, Georgia, and DeKalb County, Georgia. (9) Every major State and local city law enforcement agency receives and depends on some level of Federal funding, training, grants, or assistance, paid for primarily from the tax revenues of the citizens being abused. (10) The common and continuing unaccountable behavior and silence of members of law enforcement agencies regarding these abuses are a disgrace to the efforts of law enforcement agencies throughout the United States and should not be tolerated. (11) The lack of transparency, oversight, community involvement, independent review and investigation, and consequences to the law enforcement violators makes continuing abuse more likely, and must be reversed by denying Federal funding to any law enforcement agency that fails to establish a minimum of professional training and procedures of engagement; that tolerates abuses or fatal use of excessive force; that fails to operate under rules of transparency and community oversight, investigation, and review; that fails to discipline, remove, or otherwise hold accountable any perpetrators acting under the color of law enforcement; or that refuses to fairly hear each case or allegation of possible abuse or excessive use of force by law enforcement officers, reviewed by an established and independent forum. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of Congress that the dishonorable actions referred to in section 2 should be independently investigated, recorded, and condemned. SEC. 4. INELIGIBILITY FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. (a) In General.--During the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, or until transparency and accountability are fully restored, law enforcement agencies that do not have established procedures for independent oversight and review, or do not hold violations by police of excessive use of force, torture, or manslaughter accountable, shall be ineligible to participate in any Federal program, whether by funding, assistance, contract, grant, personnel support, or otherwise. (b) Licenses.--During the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, any Federal license issued to any such law enforcement agencies shall be suspended, or until transparency and accountability are fully restored. (c) Equipment.--Law enforcement agencies identified as carrying out abuses or wrongful deaths, without consequence or open public review or allegations, shall immediately return all federally-owned equipment in the possession or use of such law enforcement agencies to the appropriate Federal agency. SEC. 5. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DEFINED. In this Act, the term ``law enforcement agencies'' means the following entities in any State or locality within the control and jurisdiction of the United States receiving Federal funds for training, equipment, or other support.

Summary:"," Law Enforcement Abuse Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006 - Expresses the sense of Congress that incidences of law enforcement abuse of citizens should be independently investigated, recorded, and condemned. Renders state or local law enforcement agencies receiving assistance from the federal government ineligible for further assistance, licenses, or federally-owned equipment until such agencies establish procedures for independent oversight and review and hold police officers accountable for excessive use of force, torture, or manslaughter.

Summary:"," Comprehensive Learning Assessment for Students and Schools (CLASS) Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to revise requirements affecting adequate yearly progress (AYP) assessments of students against state academic performance standards. Allows AYP longitudinal growth calculations and the averaging of school data in a manner designed to stabilize school-building results from year to year. Identifies a school as needing improvement, corrective action, or restructuring only on the basis of the unsatisfactory AYP of a particular group of students in the same academic subject for the requisite period of time. Requires multiple measures of student academic achievement. Requires academic achievement standards to calculate AYP within a continuum of achievement by children within advanced, proficient, and basic achievement levels. Allows states to use the results of subsequent assessments of students who take more than one assessment for the same grade and subject. Limits the provision of supplemental services and transfers to those students who fall within a group whose underperformance results in the school's failure to make AYP. Requires state assessments to be aligned with curriculum and instruction so their effectiveness may be assessed. Requires alternate standards and assessments for disabled children aligned with the child's individualized education program. Allows states to measure the AYP of limited English proficient (LEP) children by including children that have attained English proficiency and excluding LEP children who have resided in the country for less than three years. Allows states to set separate starting points for measuring the AYP of each student group. [end] "

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Clinical Research Enhancement Act of 1999''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Clinical research is critical to the advancement of scientific knowledge and to the development of cures and improved treatment for disease. (2) Tremendous advances in biology are opening doors to new insights into human physiology, pathophysiology and disease, creating extraordinary opportunities for clinical research. (3) Clinical research includes translational research which is an integral part of the research process leading to general human applications. It is the bridge between the laboratory and new methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention and is thus essential to progress against cancer and other diseases. (4) The United States will spend more than $1,200,000,000,000 on health care in 1999, but the Federal budget for health research at the National Institutes of Health was $15,600,000,000 only 1 percent of that total. (5) Studies at the Institute of Medicine, the National Research Council, and the National Academy of Sciences have all addressed the current problems in clinical research. (6) The Director of the National Institutes of Health has recognized the current problems in clinical research and appointed a special panel, which recommended expanded support for existing National Institutes of Health clinical research programs and the creation of new initiatives to recruit and retain clinical investigators. (7) The current level of training and support for health professionals in clinical research is fragmented, undervalued, and underfunded. (8) Young investigators are not only apprentices for future positions but a crucial source of energy, enthusiasm, and ideas in the day-to-day research that constitutes the scientific enterprise. Serious questions about the future of life-science research are raised by the following: (A) The number of young investigators applying for grants dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993. (B) The number of physicians applying for first- time National Institutes of Health research project grants fell from 1226 in 1994 to 963 in 1998, a 21 percent reduction. (C) Newly independent life-scientists are expected to raise funds to support their new research programs and a substantial proportion of their own salaries. (9) The following have been cited as reasons for the decline in the number of active clinical researchers, and those choosing this career path: (A) A medical school graduate incurs an average debt of $85,619, as reported in the Medical School Graduation Questionnaire by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). (B) The prolonged period of clinical training required increases the accumulated debt burden. (C) The decreasing number of mentors and role models. (D) The perceived instability of funding from the National Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies. (E) The almost complete absence of clinical research training in the curriculum of training grant awardees. (F) Academic Medical Centers are experiencing difficulties in maintaining a proper environment for research in a highly competitive health care marketplace, which are compounded by the decreased willingness of third party payers to cover health care costs for patients engaged in research studies and research procedures. (10) In 1960, general clinical research centers were established under the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health with an initial appropriation of $3,000,000. (11) Appropriations for general clinical research centers in fiscal year 1999 equaled $200,500,000. (12) Since the late 1960s, spending for general clinical research centers has declined from approximately 3 percent to 1 percent of the National Institutes of Health budget.

It amends title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to reinstate the six-year statute of limitations on actions to recover on defaulted student loans. The bill prohibits collecting the amount owed on a defaulted federal student loan through: (1) offsets of social security, railroad retirement, or black lung benefits, (2) offsets of tax refunds. Or (3) wage garnishment. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from an individual's gross income: (1) discharged student loan debt, and (2) income distributions from qualified tuition plans that are used to pay the interest or principal on student loans. The bill makes parent PLUS loans eligible for income-contingent repayment plans, including the Pay As You Earn repayment plan. Additionally, it makes parent PLUS loans and consolidation loans that repay parent PLUS loans eligible for income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness for service in areas of national need. It prohibits: (1) evidence of an individual's default on a federal student loan from being used in a federal or state proceeding involving the individual's professional or vocational license, and (2) an institution of higher education from blocking access to a student's records due to federal student loan default. Finally, the bill modifies the public service loan forgiveness program to require the Department of Education to forgive 50 of the Direct loan balance for an eligible borrower who is employed in a public service job and makes 60 monthly payments after October 1, 2015.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Hydroelectric Licensing Process Improvement Act of 2001''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds that-- (1) hydroelectric power is an irreplaceable source of clean, economic, renewable energy with the unique capability of supporting reliable electric service while maintaining environmental quality; (2) hydroelectric power is the leading renewable energy resource of the United States; (3) hydroelectric power projects provide multiple benefits to the United States, including recreation, irrigation, flood control, water supply, and fish and wildlife benefits; (4) in the next 15 years, the bulk of all non-Federal hydroelectric power capacity in the United States is due to be relicensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; (5) the process of licensing hydroelectric projects by the Commission-- (A) does not produce optimal decisions, because the agencies that participate in the process are not required to consider the full effects of their mandatory and recommended conditions on a license; (B) is inefficient, in part because agencies do not always submit their mandatory and recommended conditions by a time certain; (C) is burdened by uncoordinated environmental reviews and duplicative permitting authority; and (D) is burdensome for all participants and too often results in litigation; and (6) while the alternative licensing procedures available to applicants for hydroelectric project licenses provide important opportunities for the collaborative resolution of many of the issues in hydroelectric project licensing, those procedures are not appropriate in every case and cannot substitute for statutory reforms of the hydroelectric licensing process. SEC. 3. PURPOSE. The purpose of this Act is to achieve the objective of relicensing hydroelectric power projects to maintain high environmental standards while preserving low cost power by-- (1) requiring agencies to consider the full effects of their mandatory and recommended conditions on a hydroelectric power license and to document the consideration of a broad range of factors; (2) requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose deadlines by which Federal agencies must submit proposed mandatory and recommended conditions to a license; and (3) making other improvements in the licensing process.

(3) Women in our country continue to face inequalities and discrimination in many areas of public and private life, including but not limited to these examples: (A) The United States ranks 71st in the world in the number of women in elected office. In 2009, women make up 17 percent of Congress and 24 percent of State legislative office-holders. Women of color make up 4 percent of Congress and 2 percent of State legislative office-holders. (B) Women earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. African-American women earn 69 cents on the dollar compared to men. Latinas earn 59 cents compared to men.

Requires such plans to give a participant or beneficiary whose nonforfeitable accrued benefit attributable to employee contributions is invested in whole or in part in employer securities a reasonable opportunity periodically to invest such accrued benefit in investment vehicles, other than employer securities, selected to permit diversification. Prohibits plan sponsors, administrators, or other fiduciaries from imposing any lockdown in connection with the nonforfeitable accrued benefit of a participant or beneficiary. Amends ERISA and IRC to provide for vesting of elective deferrals under such plans for participants who have completed three years of plan participation. [end] "

SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that: (1) By Interstate Compact (Chapter 170 of the Laws of 1937 of the State of New York; Chapter 148 of the Laws of 1937 of the State of New Jersey) and by Resolution of the 75th Congress (H.J. Resolution 445), the Palisades Interstate Park Commission was formed in 1937. (2) The Palisades Interstate Park Commission is the only interstate park management agency in the United States and is responsible for the management of 23 parks and historic sites in New York and New Jersey, consisting of 82,000 acres. More than 8,000,000 national and international visitors per year seek outdoor recreational opportunities in the Palisades Park System. The management of these sites is consistent with standards maintained by the National Park Service. (3) Sterling Forest is a biologically diverse 17,500 acre corporate-owned open space property on the New York/New Jersey border. The property is a highly significant watershed area for northern New Jersey, and an important outdoor recreational asset in the Northeastern United States. Clean drinking water flows from the property into a reservoir system which serves 25 percent of the population of the State of New Jersey. Twenty- seven rare and endangered wildlife species have been identified at Sterling Forest by The Nature Conservancy. The land supports a mixed hardwood forest, wetlands, lakes, glaciated valleys and ridge lines, and is strategically located on a north-south wildlife migratory route. (4) The Appalachian Trail, administered by the National Park Service, passes through Sterling Forest. Sterling Forest shares a common boundary with the 51,680 acre Harriman/Bear Mountain State Parks in which the first segment of the Appalachian Trail was constructed in 1923. If protected, Sterling Forest would greatly enhance the Appalachian Trail and would become the largest park created in the Northeastern United States since World War II. (5) Sterling Forest is located in the most densely populated metropolitan region in the United States, and is a very critical open space buffer for a large urban population. A 14 percent growth rate is projected for the region in the next 20 years. (6) Lands held and managed by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission in the State of New York traditionally remain on the tax rolls. Taxes are paid by the State. (7) Stewardship and management costs for lands in the Palisades Park System traditionally are paid by the States of New York and New Jersey. (8) The Palisades Interstate Park Commission is committed to a willing seller--willing buyer transaction with the corporate owners of Sterling Forest. Use of eminent domain authority is not anticipated, nor would it be acceptable to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. (9) In establishing the Federal Agencies Program for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Congress specified the need to address the increasing demand for the creation of recreation areas of national significance easily accessible to large centers of the population, and to provide a partial basis for financing the extension of Federal recreational facilities in the East and Midwest. (10) Given the nationally significant watershed, outdoor recreational, and wildlife attributes of Sterling Forest, the demand for park open space in the Northeastern United States, the lack of open space in the densely populated New York-New Jersey-Connecticut Tri-State Region, and the presence of a willing seller and a federally chartered interstate park management agency, there is clear Federal interest in acquiring land in Sterling Forest for permanent protection of watershed, recreational, and wild flora and fauna open space. SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION. (a) Funding.--In order to enhance protection of watershed, outdoor recreational, wildlife habitat, and Appalachian Trail values in the Sterling Forest area of the New York/New Jersey Highlands Region, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior for transfer to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Commission'') for fiscal year 1995 not more than $35,000,000 to be used by the Commission for purposes of acquiring an undeveloped, open space tract of land presently owned by the Sterling Forest Corporation. Such sums shall remain available for expenditure through fiscal year 1999. (b) Property Taxes.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the United States Government, or relieve the Commission and the State of New York of any obligation otherwise imposed under New York State law, to pay property taxes or provide for the costs of stewardship and management of any lands located in the State of New York which may be acquired through this authorization. (c) Management.--The Commission shall hold and manage all property acquired with funds made available under this Act for the purposes referred to in subsection (a).

Summary:"," Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of the Interior to be transferred to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission to be used to acquire an undeveloped, open space tract of land presently owned by the Sterling Forest Corporation to protect the watershed, outdoor recreational, wildlife habitat, and Appalachian Trail values in the Sterling Forest area of the New YorkNew Jersey Highlands Region. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the Government, or relieve the Commission and New York of any obligation otherwise imposed under New York State law, to pay property taxes or provide for the costs of stewardship and management of any lands located in New York that may be acquired through this authorization. Requires the Commission to hold and manage all property acquired with funds made available in this Act for the purposes specified in it. [end] "

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Video Choice Act of 2005''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Cable rates continue to rise substantially faster than the overall rate of inflation. (2) Wire-based competition in video services is limited to very few markets. According to the Federal Communications Commission, only 2 percent of all cable subscribers have the opportunity to choose between 2 or more wire-based video service providers. (3) It is only through wire-based video competition that price competition exists. The Government Accountability Office has confirmed that where wire-based competition exists, cable rates are 15 percent lower than in markets without competition. (4) It is in the public interest to further wire-based competition in the video services market in order to provide greater consumer choice and lower prices for video services. (5) To spur competition in the communications industry, Congress has decreased the regulatory burden on new entrants, thereby increasing entry into the market and creating competition. (6) The United States continues to fall behind in broadband deployment rates. According to a recent study by the International Telecommunications Union, the United States is now ranked 16th in the world in broadband deployment. (7) The deployment of advanced high capacity networks would greatly spur economic development in rural America. (8) The deployment of advanced networks that can offer substantially higher capacity are critical to the long-term competitiveness of the United States. SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO COMMUNICATIONS ACT.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Identification Card Act 2015''. SEC. 2. VETERANS IDENTIFICATION CARD. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Effective on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, veteran identification cards were issued to veterans who have either completed the statutory time-in-service requirement for retirement from the Armed Forces or who have received a medical- related discharge from the Armed Forces. (2) Effective on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, a veteran who served a minimum obligated time in service, but who did not meet the criteria described in paragraph (1), did not receive a means of identifying the veteran's status as a veteran other than using the Department of Defense form DD-214 discharge papers of the veteran. (3) Goods, services, and promotional activities are often offered by public and private institutions to veterans who demonstrate proof of service in the military, but it is impractical for a veteran to always carry Department of Defense form DD-214 discharge papers to demonstrate such proof. (4) A general purpose veteran identification card made available to veterans would be useful to demonstrate the status of the veterans without having to carry and use official Department of Defense form DD-214 discharge papers. (5) On the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, the Department of Veterans Affairs had the infrastructure in place across the United States to produce photographic identification cards and accept a small payment to cover the cost of these cards. (b) Provision of Veteran Identification Cards.--Chapter 57 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding after section 5705 the following new section: ``Sec. 5706. Veterans identification card ``(a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall issue an identification card described in subsection (b) to each veteran who-- ``(1) requests such card; ``(2) presents a copy of Department of Defense form DD-214 or other official document from the official military personnel file of the veteran that describes the service of the veteran; and ``(3) pays the fee under subsection (c)(1). ``(b) Identification Card.--An identification card described in this subsection is a card issued to a veteran that-- ``(1) displays a photograph of the veteran; ``(2) displays the name of the veteran; ``(3) explains that such card is not proof of any benefits to which the veteran is entitled to; ``(4) contains an identification number that is not a social security number; and ``(5) serves as proof that such veteran-- ``(A) served in the Armed Forces; and ``(B) has a Department of Defense form DD-214 or other official document in the official military personnel file of the veteran that describes the service of the veteran. ``(c) Costs of Card.--(1) The Secretary shall charge a fee to each veteran who receives an identification card issued under this section, including a replacement identification card. ``(2)(A) The fee charged under paragraph (1) shall equal such amount as the Secretary determines is necessary to issue an identification card under this section. ``(B) In determining the amount of the fee under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall ensure that the total amount of fees collected under paragraph (1) equals an amount necessary to carry out this section, including costs related to any additional equipment or personnel required to carry out this section. ``(C) The Secretary shall review and reassess the determination under subparagraph (A) during each five-year period in which the Secretary issues an identification card under this section. ``(3) Amounts collected under this subsection shall be deposited in an account of the Department available to carry out this section. Amounts so deposited shall be-- ``(A) merged with amounts in such account; ``(B) available in such amounts as may be provided in appropriation Acts; and ``(C) subject to the same conditions and limitations as amounts otherwise in such account. ``(d) Effect of Card on Benefits.--(1) An identification card issued under this section shall not serve as proof of any benefits that the veteran may be entitled to under this title. ``(2) A veteran who is issued an identification card under this section shall not be entitled to any benefits under this title by reason of possessing such card. ``(e) Administrative Measures.--(1) The Secretary shall ensure that any information collected or used with respect to an identification card issued under this section is appropriately secured. ``(2) The Secretary may determine any appropriate procedures with respect to issuing a replacement identification card. ``(3) In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall coordinate with the National Personnel Records Center. ``(4) The Secretary may conduct such outreach to advertise the identification card under this section as the Secretary considers appropriate. ``(f) Construction.--This section shall not be construed to affect identification cards otherwise provided by the Secretary to veterans enrolled in the health care system established under section 1705(a) of this title.''. (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 5705 the following new item: ``5706. Veterans identification card.''. (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this Act shall take effect on the date that is 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. Speaker of the House of Representatives. Vice President of the United States and President of the Senate.

Summary:"," This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on June 22, 2015. Veteran's Identification Card Act of 2015 Directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to issue a veteran's identification card to a requesting veteran who is neither entitled to military retired pay nor enrolled in the VA system of patient enrollment. Requires such card, among other things, to: (1) display the veteran's name and photograph, and (2) serve as proof that the veteran has a DD-214 form or other official document in his or her military personnel file that describes the veteran's military service. Directs VA to charge a card fee. States that such card shall not serve as proof of entitlement to any benefits. [end] "

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Afghan Women Security and Freedom Act of 2004''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Taliban regime denied women in Afghanistan the most basic human rights, including the rights to work, to an education, to health care, and to move freely. (2) The Taliban regime subjected any women who attempted to exercise her human rights to beatings and imprisonment and women in Afghanistan who lived under the Taliban regime suffer from long-term consequences of such oppression. (3) According to the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs, as a result of 23 years of war and the restrictions imposed by the Taliban after the war ended, most women in Afghanistan do not have adequate food, access to health care, or opportunities for education, employment, or economic livelihood, and such women have experienced violence to themselves or their families. (4) Women in Afghanistan have one of the highest mortality rates in the world, with an estimated 16,000 maternal deaths annually. (5) The strengthening of institutions and non-governmental organizations that are led by women in Afghanistan is essential to building civil society and holding the Government of Afghanistan accountable for protecting women's rights and human rights. (6) It is necessary for significant numbers of women to hold positions within the Government of Afghanistan, including in the cabinet, the Loya Jirga, government commissions, and other key posts, and to hold official positions within United Nations agencies working in Afghanistan to foster democracy and protect the rights of women in Afghanistan. (7) Despite the collapse of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 2001, warlords and the Taliban are reorganizing and reemerging in Afghanistan, imperiling the stability of the central government, the security of the people, and the exercise of human rights by women. (8) The United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative to Afghanistan said that the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan may force a delay in elections in Afghanistan and that expansion of international peacekeeping forces is necessary to make fair, democratic voter registration and elections possible. (9) In January 2004, the Government of Afghanistan adopted a new constitution that includes basic rights for women, but enforcement of the provisions of the constitution will be difficult unless security in Afghanistan is dramatically improved. (10) Despite the fact that violations of human rights and women's rights continue with impunity in Afghanistan, Provincial Reconstruction Teams composed of United States military forces, Department of Defense civil affairs officers, representatives of United States agencies and allied personnel do not have the authority needed to intervene to stop such violations. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the protection of the rights of women, the reestablishment of democracy, and the elimination of terrorism are essential to the reconstruction of a stable Afghanistan and to achieve such a reconstruction the international community should commit substantial resources, including the expansion of international peacekeeping forces inside and outside of the city of Kabul; (2) the United States should provide strong support for the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, both of which were created by the Bonn Agreement to remedy past violations of women's rights and human rights and to establish institutions and programs to advance such rights; (3) the mandate of international peacekeeping forces and Provincial Reconstruction Teams composed of United States military forces, Department of Defense civil affairs officers, representatives of United States agencies and allied personnel should be authorized to intervene to stop violations of human rights and women's rights; (4) United States foreign policy should ensure that the rights of women and girls are restored in Afghanistan, assist in the recovery of women and girls from the repression of the Taliban and 23 years of war, and strengthen Afghan institutions that are led by women; and (5) grants and assistance provided to Afghanistan should be conditioned upon the Government of Afghanistan adhering to international standards for women's rights and human rights.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Put School Counselors Where They're Needed Act''. SEC. 2. DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR ADDITIONAL SECONDARY SCHOOL COUNSELORS. (a) In General.--Part H of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6551 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``Subpart 3--Demonstration Project for Additional Secondary School Counselors ``SEC. 1841. FINDINGS. ``Congress finds the following: ``(1) Nationally, only 70 percent of students graduate from high school with a regular high school diploma. ``(2) Every school day, 7,000 high school students in the United States become dropouts. ``(3) High school students living in low-income families drop out of school at 6 times the rate of their peers from high-income families. ``(4) Only about 55 percent of African-American students and 52 percent of Hispanic students graduate on time from high school with a regular diploma, compared to 78 percent of white students. ``(5) The dropout rate for students with disabilities is approximately twice that of general education students. ``(6) High school is the final transition into adulthood and the world of work as students begin separating from parents and exploring and defining their independence. Students who are deciding who they are and what they will do when they graduate face many pressures, including high-stakes testing, the challenges of college admissions, the scholarship and financial aid application process, and entrance into a competitive job market. They need guidance in these complex decisions, which have serious and life changing consequences. ``(7) School counseling programs are essential for students to achieve optimal personal growth, acquire positive social skills and values, set appropriate career goals, and realize full academic potential to become productive, contributing members of the world community. ``(8) Professional secondary school counselors are highly qualified educators with a mental health perspective who understand and respond to the challenges presented by today's diverse student population. ``(9) The professional secondary school counselor holds a master's degree or higher in school counseling (or the substantial equivalent), and is certified or licensed by the State in which the counselor works. ``(10) Professional secondary school counselors are integral to the total educational program. They provide proactive leadership that engages all stakeholders in the delivery of programs and services to help the student achieve success in school. Professional secondary school counselors align and work with the school's mission to support the academic achievement of all students as they prepare for the ever-changing world of the 21st century. ``(11) Professional secondary school counselors' opportunities to assist students are often hindered by extraordinarily high student-to-counselor ratios. Currently, the average student-to-counselor ratio in America's public schools is 479 to 1. The American School Counselor Association, the American Counseling Association, and the National Association for College Admissions Counseling all recommend a ratio of 1 school counselor to 250 students and a lower ratio for counselors working primarily with students at risk. ``SEC. 1842. DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. ``(a) In General.--From amounts made available to carry out this subpart, the Secretary shall carry out a demonstration project under which the Secretary makes grants on a competitive basis to secondary schools that receive funds under this title and have a 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rate of 60 percent or lower. ``(b) Grants.--A grant under this section shall be for a period of 4 years and may be used-- ``(1) to provide additional school counselors during that period; and ``(2) to provide additional resources (such as professional development expenses or travel expenses for home visits, and any services and materials referred to in subsection (d)) and to pay overhead expenses. ``(c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that a secondary school that receives a grant under this section should aim to provide, under subsection (b)(1), 1 additional counselor per 250 students at risk. ``(d) Scope of Counseling.--The additional school counselors provided with funds under this subpart shall identify students who are at risk of not graduating in 4 years and shall provide counseling primarily to those students. The counselors may identify such students at any time, but shall strive to identify the students before the students enter grade 9. Services shall be provided as long as necessary, including to the extent allowable and appropriate, after the student's cohort graduation date. The counseling provided-- ``(1) may include a full panoply of services, including an individual graduation plan and other resources, such as appropriate course placement and supplemental services (to include not only supplemental educational services tutoring if available at the school site, but also other tutoring as necessary, along with supplemental books and materials); and ``(2) shall include meetings with each student identified under this subsection and with the teachers, tutors, supplemental educational services providers, and parents of the student, and may also include meetings with other relevant individuals, such as a probation officer, mentor, coach, or employer of the student. ``(e) Supplement Not Supplant.--Funds provided under this subpart shall be used to supplement, and not supplant, funds from non-Federal sources available to carry out activities described in this section. The additional school counselors provided through funds under this subpart shall be in addition to any employees who work in the secondary school guidance or counseling office, such as counselors, college admissions specialists, career development specialists, guidance information specialists, or any other professional or paraprofessional. ``(f) Additional Grant Periods.-- ``(1) In general.--A secondary school that receives a grant under this section and demonstrates adequate improvement over the period of the grant is eligible to receive a second grant for a second period. If the secondary school again demonstrates adequate improvement over that second period, the school is eligible to receive a third grant for a third period. The third grant shall provide amounts that decrease for each year of the third period and require the school to provide corresponding increases in non-Federal funds. ``(2) Adequate improvement.--For purposes of paragraph (1), a school demonstrates adequate improvement over a grant period if the 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rate increases (or is projected to increase) by 10 percent or more over that period. ``(g) Selection.--The Secretary shall carry out the demonstration project under this section in not less than 10 schools. The first 5 schools selected to participate shall each be from a different State. ``SEC. 1843. DEFINITIONS. ``In this subpart: ``(1) 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.--The term `4- year adjusted cohort graduation rate' means the number of students who earned a regular high school diploma at the conclusion of their fourth year, before their fourth year, or during a summer session immediately following their fourth year, divided by the number of students who formed the adjusted cohort for that graduating class. ``(2) Adjusted cohort.-- ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F), the term `adjusted cohort' means the students who entered grade 9 together, and any students that transferred into the cohort in grade 9 through 12 minus any students removed from the cohort as described in subparagraph (C). ``(B) Transfers in.--The term `transfers in' means enrolls or re-enrolls after the beginning of the entering cohort's first year in high school, up to and including in grade 12. ``(C) Cohort removal.--To remove students from a cohort, the school or local educational agency shall confirm that the student-- ``(i) has transferred out; ``(ii) is in the custody of the juvenile justice system; or ``(iii) is deceased. ``(D) Transfers out.-- ``(i) In general.--Subject to clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv), the term `transfers out' means transfers to another school, local educational agency, or other educational program from which the student is expected to receive a regular high school diploma. ``(ii) Confirmation.--Confirmation of a student's transfer to another school, local educational agency, or program requires formal documentation that the student enrolled in the receiving school. ``(iii) Not considered transfers.--A student who enrolls in a GED or other alternative educational program that does not issue or provide credits toward the issuance of a regular high school diploma shall not be considered to have transferred out for purposes of this subparagraph. ``(iv) Remain in cohort.--A student who was enrolled in a school, but for whom there is no confirmation of transfer or completion, may not be labeled a transfer or error, but shall remain in the cohort as a non-graduate for reporting and accountability purposes. ``(E) Treatment of other leavers and withdrawals.-- A student who was retained in a grade, enrolled in a GED program, or left school for any other reason may not be counted as a transfer out for the purpose of calculating graduation rates and shall remain in the adjusted cohort. ``(F) Special rule.--For those high schools that start after ninth grade, the cohort shall be calculated based on the earliest high school grade. ``(3) Regular high school diploma.-- ``(A) In general.--The term `regular high school diploma' means the standard high school diploma awarded to the preponderance of students in the State that is fully aligned with State standards, or a higher diploma, and does not include GEDs, certificates of attendance, or any lesser diploma award. ``(B) Special rule.--For a student who has a significant cognitive disability and is assessed using an alternate assessment aligned to alternate achievement standards, receipt of a regular high school diploma or State-defined alternate diploma aligned with completion of the student's entitlement under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act shall be counted as a graduate with a regular high school diploma for the purposes of this subpart. Not more than 1 percent of students in a school may be counted as graduates with a regular high school diploma under this subparagraph. ``SEC. 1844. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. ``There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subpart $6,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2011.''. (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents in section 2 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 1830 the following: ``subpart 3--demonstration project for additional secondary school counselors ``Sec. 1841.

Borlaug, was born in Iowa where he grew up on a family farm, and received his primary and secondary education. (2) Dr. Borlaug attended the University of Minnesota where he received his B.A. and Ph.D. degrees and was also a star NCAA wrestler. (3) For the past 20 years, Dr. Borlaug has lived in Texas where he is a member of the faculty of Texas A&M University. (4) Dr. Borlaug also serves as President of the Sasakawa Africa Association. (5) Dr. Borlaug's accomplishments in terms of bringing radical change to world agriculture and uplifting humanity are without parallel. (6) In the immediate aftermath of World War II, Dr. Borlaug spent 20 years working in the poorest areas of rural Mexico. It was there that Dr. Borlaug made his breakthrough achievement in developing a strain of wheat that could exponentially increase yields while actively resisting disease. (7) With the active support of the governments involved, Dr. Borlaug's ``green revolution'' uplifted hundreds of thousands of the rural poor in Mexico and saved hundreds of millions from famine and outright starvation in India and Pakistan. (8) Dr. Borlaug's approach to wheat production next spread throughout the Middle East. Soon thereafter his approach was adapted to rice growing, increasing the number of lives Dr. Borlaug has saved to more than a billion people. (9) In 1970, Dr. Borlaug received the Nobel Prize, the only person working in agriculture to ever be so honored. Since then he has received numerous honors and awards including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Public Service Medal, the National Academy of Sciences' highest honor, and the Rotary International Award for World Understanding and Peace. (10) At age 91, Dr. Borlaug continues to work to alleviate poverty and malnutrition. He currently serves as president of Sasakawa Global 2000 Africa Project, which seeks to extend the benefits of agricultural development to the 800,000,000 people still mired in poverty and malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. (11) Dr. Borlaug continues to serve as Chairman of the Council of Advisors of the World Food Prize, an organization he created in 1986 to be the ``Nobel Prize for Food and Agriculture'' and which presents a $250,000 prize each October at a Ceremony in Des Moines, Iowa, to the Laureate who has made an exceptional achievement similar to Dr. Borlaug's breakthrough 40 years ago. In the almost 20 years of its existence, the World Food Prize has honored Laureates from Bangladesh, India, China, Mexico, Denmark, Sierra Leone, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. (12) Dr. Borlaug has saved more lives than any other person who has ever lived, and likely has saved more lives in the Islamic world than any other human being in history. (13) Due to a lifetime of work that has led to the saving and preservation of an untold amount of lives, Dr. Norman E. Borlaug is deserving of America's highest civilian award: the congressional gold medal. SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.

(4) The United States is experiencing epidemics in diabetes and obesity among adults and children, at the same time a majority of the population is sedentary and eats an unhealthy diet. (5) Per capita medical care costs in the United States are more than double those of all but 4 other countries in the world, yet the United States ranks 42nd in the world in life expectancy. (6) Medical care costs are second only to education in State government budgets. (7) Lifestyle factors are responsible for at least 25 percent of employer's medical care costs in the United States. (8) National costs of obesity account for 9.1 percent of all medical costs, reaching $93,000,000 in 2002. Approximately \1/2\ of these costs were paid by the Medicare & Medicaid Programs. (9) More than 440,000 people die each year from tobacco use and more than 12,000,000 are living with chronic conditions caused by tobacco. Tobacco accounts for at least $96,000,000,000 in direct medical expenditures. (10) Significant gaps exist in the basic and applied research base of health promotion regarding how to best reach and serve people of color, low-income people, people with little formal education, children, and older adults, how to create long-term health improvements, how to create supportive environments, and how to address gender issues. More focused research can reduce these gaps. (11) Significant gaps exist between the best and the typical health promotion programs. Better synthesis and dissemination of results can reduce these gaps. (12) Health promotion is the art and science of motivating people to enhance their lifestyles to achieve complete health, not just the absence of disease. Complete health involves a balance of physical, mental, and social health. (13) Health promotion programs focus on practices such as exercising regularly, eating a nutritious diet, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, avoiding dangerous substances such as tobacco and illegal drugs, drinking alcohol in moderation or not at all, driving safely, being wise consumers of health care, and a number of other health related practices. (14) The most effective health promotion programs include a combination of strategies to increase awareness, enhance motivation, facilitate behavior change, and develop cultures and physical environments that encourage and support healthy lifestyle practices. (15) Health promotion programs can be provided in family, clinical, child care, school, workplace, Federal, State, and community settings. (16) People living in rural areas have additional unique challenges of high risk work environments, more limited access to major educational and medical complexes, as well as facilities for fitness and recreational facilities and in some cases to grocery stores. (17) Individuals with physical disabilities respond very well to exercise treatment. This is a core component of all high quality physical therapy programs. However, additional research and more intensive efforts to disseminate information in this area are necessary. SEC. 3. HEALTH PROMOTION RESEARCH AND DISSEMINATION.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Local Community Radio Act of 2007''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 led to increased ownership consolidation in the radio industry. (2) At a hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, on June 4, 2003, all 5 members of the Federal Communications Commission testified that there has been, in at least some local radio markets, too much consolidation. (3) A commitment to localism--local operations, local research, local management, locally-originated programming, local artists, and local news and events--would bolster radio listening. (4) Local communities have sought to launch radio stations to meet their local needs. However, due to the scarce amount of spectrum available and the high cost of buying and running a large station, many local communities are unable to establish a radio station. (5) In 2003, the average cost to acquire a commercial radio station was more than $2,500,000. (6) In January, 2000, the Federal Communications Commission authorized a new, affordable community radio service called ``low-power FM'' or ``LPFM'' to ``enhance locally focused community-oriented radio broadcasting''. (7) Through the creation of LPFM, the Commission sought to ``create opportunities for new voices on the air waves and to allow local groups, including schools, churches, and other community-based organizations, to provide programming responsive to local community needs and interests''. (8) The Commission made clear that the creation of LPFM would not compromise the integrity of the FM radio band by stating, ``We are committed to creating a low-power FM radio service only if it does not cause unacceptable interference to existing radio service.''. (9) Currently, FM translator stations can operate on the second- and third-adjacent channels to full power radio stations, up to an effective radiated power of 250 watts, pursuant to part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, using the very same transmitters that LPFM stations will use. The Commission based its LPFM rules on the actual performance of these translators that already operate without undue interference to FM stations. The actual interference record of these translators is far more useful than any results that further testing could yield. (10) Small rural broadcasters were particularly concerned about a lengthy and costly interference complaint process. Therefore, in September, 2000, the Commission created a simple process to address interference complaints regarding LPFM stations on an expedited basis. (11) In December, 2000, Congress delayed the full implementation of LPFM until an independent engineering study was completed and reviewed. This delay was due to some broadcasters' concerns that LPFM service would cause interference in the FM band. (12) The delay prevented millions of Americans from having a locally operated, community based radio station in their neighborhood. (13) Over 500 LPFM stations were allowed to proceed despite the congressional action. These stations are currently on the air and are run by local government agencies, groups promoting arts and education to immigrant and indigenous peoples, artists, schools, religious organizations, environmental groups, organizations promoting literacy, and many other civically-oriented organizations. (14) After 2 years and the expenditure of $2,193,343 in taxpayer dollars to conduct this study, the broadcasters' concerns were demonstrated to be unsubstantiated. (15) Minorities represent almost a third of our population. However, according to the Federal Communication Commission's most recent Form 323 data on the race and gender of full power, commercial broadcast licensees, minorities own only 7 percent of all local television and radio stations. Women represent more than half of the population, but own only 6 percent of all local television and radio stations. LPFM stations, while not a solution to the overall inequalities in minority and female broadcast ownership, provide an additional opportunity for underrepresented communities to operate a station and provide local communities with a greater diversity of viewpoints and culture. (16) LPFM stations have proven to be a vital source of information during local or national emergencies. Out of the few stations that were able to stay online during Katrina, several were LPFM stations. In Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, LPFM station WQRZ remained on the air during Hurricane Katrina and served as the Emergency Operations Center for Hancock County. Additionally, after Hurricane Katrina when thousands of evacuees temporarily housed at the Houston Astrodome were unable to hear information about the availability of food and ice, the location of FEMA representatives, and the whereabouts of missing loved ones over the loud speakers, volunteers handed out thousands of transistor radios and established a LPFM station outside the Astrodome to broadcast such information. SEC. 3. REPEAL OF PRIOR LAW. Section 632 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 (Public Law 106-553; 114 Stat. 2762A-111), is repealed. SEC. 4. MINIMUM DISTANCE SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS. The Federal Communications Commission shall modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between-- (1) low-power FM stations; and (2) full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations. SEC. 5. PROTECTION OF RADIO READING SERVICES. The Federal Communications Commission shall retain its rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power non-commercial FM stations that broadcast radio reading services via a subcarrier frequency from potential low-power FM station interference. SEC. 6. ENSURING AVAILABILITY OF SPECTRUM FOR LPFM STATIONS. The Federal Communications Commission when licensing FM translator stations shall ensure-- (1) that licenses are available to both FM translator stations and low-power FM stations; and (2) that such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community. SEC. 7. PROHIBITIONS ON CERTAIN APPLICANTS. The Federal Communications Commission shall modify the rules authorizing the operation of low-power FM radio stations, as proposed in MM Docket No. 99-25, to prohibit any applicant from obtaining a low- power FM license if the applicant has engaged in any manner in the unlicensed operation of any station in violation of section 301 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301). SEC. 8. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION RULES. The Federal Communications Commission shall retain its rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power FM stations that are licensed in significantly populated States with more than 3,000,000 housing units and a population density greater than 1,000 people per square mile land area. SEC. 9. FCC STUDY ON IMPACT OF LPFM ON FULL-POWER COMMERCIAL FM STATIONS. The Federal Communications Commission shall conduct an economic study on the impact that low-power FM stations will have on full-power commercial FM stations.

Summary:"," Local Community Radio Act of 2007 - Repeals provisions in the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, that required the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: (1) modify rules authorizing the operation of low-power FM radio stations to prescribe minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels. (2) prohibit applicants who have engaged in the unlicensed operation of any station from obtaining a low-power FM license. And (3) conduct a program to test whether low-power FM radio stations will result in harmful interference to existing FM radio stations if minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels are not required. Requires the FCC to: (1) modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between specified stations. And (2) retain rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power noncommercial FM stations that broadcast radio reading services via a subcarrier frequency from potential low-power FM station interference. Requires the FCC, when licensing FM translator stations, to ensure: (1) that licenses are available to both FM translator stations and low-power FM stations. And (2) that such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community. Requires the FCC to: (1) modify rules authorizing the operation of low-power FM radio stations, as proposed in a specified docket, to prohibit any applicant from obtaining a low-power FM license if the applicant has engaged in any manner in the unlicensed operation of any station. (2) retain its rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power FM stations that are licensed in states with more than 3,000,000 housing units and a population density greater than 1,000 people per square mile land area. And (3) conduct an economic study on the impact that low-power FM stations will have on full-power commercial FM stations. [end] "

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Tobacco to 21 Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Tobacco use caused 20,800,000 premature deaths in the United States in the 50 years since the Surgeon General's first report on smoking in 1964. (2) The 1964 Surgeon General's report linked cigarette smoking to cancer, and since then, other tobacco products, including cigars, cigarillos, roll-your-own products, and smokeless tobacco have been causally linked to cancer. (3) While substantial gains have been made since 1964, tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, responsible for approximately 500,000 premature deaths each year. (4) Tobacco use costs the United States approximately $170,000,000,000 in direct medical costs and $156,000,000,000 in lost productivity every year. (5) More than 42,000,000 people in the United States still smoke, and the tobacco industry continues to challenge tobacco control victories in court, manipulate products to evade existing regulations, introduce new and dangerous tobacco products, and spend billions on marketing to deceive the public and addict more children. (6) An estimated 5,600,000 youth aged 17 and under are projected to die prematurely from a tobacco-related illness if prevalence rates do not change. (7) Use of tobacco products in any form is not safe, especially during adolescence, as such use can lead to nicotine dependence and subsequent tobacco-related diseases and death. (8) Adolescents are especially vulnerable to the effects of nicotine and nicotine addiction and appear to show signs of nicotine addiction at lower levels of exposure compared to adults. (9) Nicotine exposure during adolescence may have long lasting adverse consequences on brain development. (10) The likelihood of developing smoking-related cancers increases with duration of smoking. Therefore those users that start at younger ages and continue to smoke are at higher risk for tobacco-related disease and death. (11) National data show that 95 percent of adult smokers begin smoking before they turn 21. The ages of 18 to 21 are a critical period when many smokers move from experimental smoking to regular, daily use. (12) Young adults aged 18 to 24 are more than 2 times as likely to use smokeless products as compared to older adults aged 45 to 64. (13) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute of Medicine recommend comprehensive and sustained tobacco control programs and policies at the Federal, State, and local level in order to reduce youth initiation and the prevalence of tobacco use. (14) Regulating the retail environment, actively enforcing laws, and educating retailers are strategies that Federal, State, and local governments can take to restrict the availability of tobacco products to youth. (15) The recent report of the Institute of Medicine entitled, ``Public Health Implications of Raising the Minimum Age of Legal Access to Tobacco Products'', concluded that raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products nationwide will reduce tobacco initiation, particularly among adolescents aged 15 to 17, and will improve health across the lifespan and save lives. Specifically, the report said that raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products nationwide to age 21 would, over time, lead to a 12-percent decrease in smoking prevalence. (16) The Institute of Medicine report also predicts that raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products nationwide to age 21 would result in 223,000 fewer premature deaths, 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer, and 4,200,000 fewer years of life lost for those born between 2000 and 2019. In addition, the report concluded that raising the minimum legal age of sale would result in near immediate reductions in preterm birth, low birth weight, and sudden infant death syndrome. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION AND ENFORCEMENT. (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including any Federal regulation, it shall be unlawful to sell or distribute a tobacco product to anyone under the age of 21. (b) Enforcement.-- (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to enforce the prohibition under subsection (a) and shall take necessary action to enforce such prohibition, including, as appropriate-- (A) conducting undercover compliance checks, performing retailer inspections, initiating enforcement actions for noncompliance, and taking any other measures appropriate to help ensure nationwide compliance with such prohibition; and (B) establishing requirements that retailers check identification or use other methods to ensure compliance with subsection (a), or issuing guidance concerning the responsibility of retailers to ensure such compliance. (2) Enforcement authority.--In the case of a violation of subsection (a), the Secretary of Health and Human Services may apply the penalties under section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 333), as though such subsection (a) were a regulation promulgated under section 906(d)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 387f(d)(1)), notwithstanding paragraph (3)(A)(ii) of such section 906(d). (c) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``tobacco product'' has the meaning given such term in section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(rr)). SEC. 4. NON-PREEMPTION. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prevent a State or local governmental entity from establishing, enforcing, or maintaining a law with respect to sales of tobacco to individuals below a minimum age, provided that such State or local law is at least as restrictive as the Federal law.

Summary:"," Tobacco to 21 Act This bill prohibits the sale or distribution of tobacco products to individuals under the age of 21. The Department of Health and Human Services must enforce this prohibition by taking necessary actions including, as appropriate, conducting undercover compliance checks, performing retailer inspections, initiating enforcement actions for noncompliance, and establishing requirements that retailers check identification.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Unlawful Employers Accountability Act of 2005''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Current efforts to stem the tide of illegal immigrants crossing into the United States have fallen far short of need. (2) The number of illegal immigrants currently in the United States is approximating 11 million. (3) Cities, counties, and States are forced to absorb the costs of illegal immigration without compensation from the Federal Government or employers. (4) United States companies continue to recruit and hire illegal immigrants and thereby aid in the erosion of the border security of the United States. (5) The hiring of illegal immigrants has had a negative impact on the employment opportunities of legal immigrants and United States citizens. (6) Federal law expressly prohibits the hiring of illegal immigrants. (7) In 2004, only three United States companies were cited for hiring illegal immigrants. SEC. 3. COMPLIANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE UNLAWFUL EMPLOYMENT OF ALIENS. (a) Civil Penalty.--Paragraph (4) of subsection (e) of section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a) is amended to read as follows: ``(4) Cease and desist order with civil money penalty for hiring, recruiting, and referral violations.-- ``(A) In general.--With respect to a violation by any person or other entity of subsection (a)(1)(A) or (a)(2), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall require the person or entity to cease and desist from such violations and to pay a civil penalty in the amount specified in subparagraph (B). ``(B) Amount of civil penalty.--A civil penalty under this paragraph shall not be less than $50,000 for each occurrence of a violation described in subsection (a)(1)(A) or (a)(2) with respect to the alien referred to in such subsection, plus, in the event of the removal of such alien from the United States based on findings developed in connection with the assessment or collection of such penalty, the costs incurred by the Federal Government, cooperating State and local governments, and State and local law enforcement agencies, in connection with such removal. ``(C) Distribution of penalties to state and local governments.-- ``(i) In general.--Penalties collected under this paragraph from a person or entity shall be distributed as follows: ``(I) 25 percent of such amount shall be distributed to the State in which the person or entity is located. ``(II) 25 percent of such amount shall be distributed to the county in which the person or entity is located. ``(III) 25 percent of such amount shall be distributed to the municipality, if any, in which the person or entity is located, or, in the absence of such a municipality, to the county described in subclause (II). ``(D) Limitation on use of funds.--Amounts paid to a State, county, or municipality under subparagraph (C) may only be used for costs incurred by such State, county, or municipality in providing public services to aliens not lawfully present in the United States. ``(E) Distinct, physically separate subdivisions.-- In applying this subsection in the case of a person or other entity composed of distinct, physically separate subdivisions each of which provides separately for the hiring, recruiting, or referring for employment, without reference to the practices of, and not under the control of or common control with, another subdivision, each such subdivision shall be considered a separate person or other entity.''. (b) Denial of Agricultural Assistance for Violators.--Such section is further amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: ``(i) Denial of Agricultural Assistance for Violators.--In the case of a violation of subsection (a)(1)(A) or (a)(2) by an agricultural association, agricultural employer, or farm labor contractor (as defined in section 3 of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. 1802)), such association, employer, or contractor shall be ineligible for agricultural assistance described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of section 1211(a) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3811(a)) for a period not to exceed five years.''.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Birth Control Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: (1) Family planning is basic health care for women. Access to contraception helps women prevent unintended pregnancy and control the timing and spacing of planned births. (2) Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention included family planning in its published list of the Ten Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century, the United States still has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancies among industrialized nations. (3) Each year, 3,000,000 pregnancies, nearly half of all pregnancies, in the United States are unintended, and nearly half of unintended pregnancies end in abortion. (4) Women rely on prescription contraceptives for a range of medical purposes in addition to birth control, such as regulation of cycles and endometriosis. (5) The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency contraception to be safe and effective in preventing unintended pregnancy and has approved over-the-counter access to emergency contraception for individuals aged 17 and older. (6) If taken soon after unprotected sex or primary contraceptive failure, emergency contraception can significantly reduce a woman's chance of unintended pregnancy. (7) Emergency contraception works like other hormonal birth control by preventing pregnancy. It also does not harm or terminate an already-established pregnancy. (8) Access to legal contraception is a protected fundamental right in the United States and should not be impeded by one individual's personal beliefs. (9) Reports of pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions for contraceptives, including emergency contraceptives, have surfaced in States across the Nation, including Alabama, Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Since emergency contraception became available without a prescription for certain individuals, refusals to provide non-prescription emergency contraception have also been reported. SEC. 3. DUTIES OF PHARMACIES TO ENSURE PROVISION OF FDA-APPROVED CONTRACEPTION. Part B of title II of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 238 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``SEC. 249. DUTIES OF PHARMACIES TO ENSURE PROVISION OF FDA-APPROVED CONTRACEPTION. ``(a) In General.--Subject to subsection (c), a pharmacy that receives Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs or devices in interstate commerce shall maintain compliance with the following: ``(1) If a customer requests a contraceptive that is in stock, the pharmacy shall ensure that the contraceptive is provided to the customer without delay. ``(2) If a customer requests a contraceptive that is not in stock and the pharmacy in the normal course of business stocks contraception, the pharmacy shall immediately inform the customer that the contraceptive is not in stock and without delay offer the customer the following options: ``(A) If the customer prefers to obtain the contraceptive through a referral or transfer, the pharmacy shall-- ``(i) locate a pharmacy of the customer's choice or the closest pharmacy confirmed to have the contraceptive in stock;

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Ocean Acidification Research And Monitoring Act of 2008'' or the ``FOARAM Act''. (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as follows: Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. Sec. 2. Findings and purposes. Sec. 3. Definitions. Sec. 4. Interagency subcommittee. Sec. 5. Strategic research plan. Sec. 6. NOAA ocean acidification activities. Sec. 7. NSF ocean acidification activities. Sec. 8. NASA ocean acidification activities. Sec. 9. Authorization of appropriations. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following: (1) The oceans help regulate atmospheric chemistry by acting as the largest sink for carbon dioxide. (2) The rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is overwhelming the natural ability of the oceans to absorb this gas. (3) The influx of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and the subsequent absorption by the oceans is changing surface ocean carbon chemistry and lowering the pH. These changes in ocean chemistry are detrimental to organisms including corals, which support one of the richest habitats on Earth, marine shellfish, and many other organisms that form the base of the food chain for many fish and marine mammals. (4) The rich biodiversity of marine organisms is an important contribution to the national economy and the change in ocean chemistry threatens tourism, our fisheries, and marine environmental quality, and could result in significant social and economic costs. (5) Existing Federal programs support research in related ocean chemistry, but gaps in funding, coordination, and outreach have impeded national progress in addressing ocean acidification. (6) National investment in a coordinated program of research and monitoring would improve the understanding of ocean acidification effects on whole ecosystems, advance our knowledge of the socioeconomic impacts of increased ocean acidification, and strengthen the ability of marine resource managers to assess and prepare for the harmful impacts of ocean acidification on our marine resources. (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide for-- (1) development and coordination of a comprehensive interagency plan to-- (A) monitor and conduct research on the processes and consequences of ocean acidification on marine organisms and ecosystems; and (B) establish an interagency research and monitoring program on ocean acidification; (2) assessment and consideration of regional and national ecosystem and socioeconomic impacts of increased ocean acidification; and (3) research on adaptation strategies and techniques for effectively conserving marine ecosystems as they cope with increased ocean acidification. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act: (1) Ocean acidification.--The term ``ocean acidification'' means the decrease in pH of the Earth's oceans and changes in ocean chemistry caused by chemical inputs from the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide. (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (3) Subcommittee.--The term ``Subcommittee'' means the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology of the National Science and Technology Council. SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY SUBCOMMITTEE. (a) Designation.--The Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology of the National Science and Technology Council shall coordinate Federal activities on ocean acidification. (b) Duties.--The Subcommittee shall-- (1) develop the strategic research and monitoring plan to guide Federal research on ocean acidification required under section 5 of this Act and oversee the implementation of the plan; (2) oversee the development of-- (A) an assessment of the potential impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms and marine ecosystems; and (B) adaptation and mitigation strategies to conserve marine organisms and ecosystems exposed to ocean acidification; (3) facilitate communication and outreach opportunities with nongovernmental organizations and members of the stakeholder community with interests in marine resources; (4) coordinate the United States Federal research and monitoring program with research and monitoring programs and scientists from other nations; and (5) establish or designate an Ocean Acidification Information Exchange to make information on ocean acidification developed through or utilized by the interagency ocean acidification program accessible through electronic means, including information which would be useful to policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders in mitigating or adapting to the impacts of ocean acidification. (c) Reports to Congress.-- (1) Initial report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Subcommittee shall transmit a report to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Science and Technology and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives that-- (A) includes a summary of federally funded ocean acidification research and monitoring activities, including the budget for each of these activities; and (B) describes the progress in developing the plan required under section 5 of this Act. (2) Biennial report.--Not later than 2 years after the delivery of the initial report under paragraph (1) and every 2 years thereafter, the Subcommittee shall transmit a report to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Science and Technology and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives that includes-- (A) a summary of federally funded ocean acidification research and monitoring activities, including the budget for each of these activities; and (B) an analysis of the progress made toward achieving the goals and priorities for the interagency research plan developed by the Subcommittee under section 5. (3) Strategic research plan.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Subcommittee shall transmit the strategic research plan developed under section 5 to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Science and Technology and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives. A revised plan shall be submitted at least once every 5 years thereafter. SEC. 5. STRATEGIC RESEARCH PLAN.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Prescription Drug Affordability Act of 1993''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that-- (1) although prescription drugs represent one of the most frequently used medical care interventions in treating common acute and chronic diseases, many Americans, especially elderly and other vulnerable populations, are unable to afford their medications because of excessive and persistent prescription drug price inflation; (2) between 1980 and 1990, prescription drug price inflation was 3 times the rate of general inflation; (3) between 1985 and 1991, the prices of the 20 top selling prescription drugs, which account for almost a third of prescription sales, rose 79 percent--nearly 4 times the general rate of inflation; (4) prescription drug manufacturers continue to make enormous profits on the backs of the elderly, poor, and other vulnerable populations that are unable to afford their medications; (5) because of the limited availability of private or public prescription drug coverage for the elderly, prescription drugs represent the highest out-of-pocket medical care cost for 3 of 4 elderly patients, surpassed only by costs of long-term care services; (6) individuals over 65 fill an average of 15 prescriptions a year to treat chronic health conditions compared to 5 prescriptions for those under 65; (7) the Federal Government and American taxpayer provide substantial subsidies to the pharmaceutical industry in the form of tax incentives, tax write-offs, and grants for non- research activities; (8) for example, in 1987 alone, the pharmaceutical industry received a section 936 tax credit of more than $1,400,000,000, and such credit is estimated to have yielded over $2,000,000,000 in tax breaks in 1990 to such industry; (9) when Congress enacted section 936 in 1976, it sought to help Puerto Rico obtain employment-producing investments, however, in 1987 the pharmaceutical industry received over half of the tax benefits provided by section 936 but employed less than 20 percent of the workers; (10) the Department of the Treasury will lose $15,000,000,000 in tax revenues during the 1993 through 1997 period due to section 936; and (11) 17 of the 21 most prescribed drugs in the United States in 1990 are authorized for Puerto Rican manufacture. (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to insure that the elderly, the chronically ill, and all Americans have access to reasonably-priced pharmaceutical products. SEC. 3.

(2) In addition, the Mississippi Valley has also hosted Spanish, French, English, and ultimately American societies at different times in the last 450 years. (3) Blytheville, Arkansas, is centrally located in the Mississippi Valley region. (4) Former Eaker Air Force Base, which is located outside of Blytheville, Arkansas, in the central Mississippi Valley region, is the site of 14 archaeological sites associated with Native Americans. (5) Because of its value in illustrating and interpreting the heritage of the United States, the largest of these archaeological sites, was recognized by the National Park Service as a National Historic Landmark in 1996. (6) Another archaeological site outside of Blytheville, Arkansas, the Chickasawba Mound, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 because of its historic and archaeological resources. (7) These previous actions by the Department of the Interior recognize that these archaeological sites are likely to benefit, educate, and inspire present and future generations of Americans, but no unified heritage park for the central Mississippi Valley region exists within the National Park Service. (8) Blytheville, Arkansas, also possesses many other regionally and nationally significant natural, seismic, cultural, and recreational resources associated with the heritage of the central Mississippi Valley region. (9) The sites and resources associated with the heritage of the central Mississippi Valley region require recognition through the establishment of a national historical park for the central Mississippi Valley region as a unit of the National Park System. (10) As a result of the closing of Eaker Air Force Base in Blytheville, Arkansas, pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, Federal land and facilities are readily available for the establishment of a national historical park for the central Mississippi Valley region to protect the archaeological sites located on the former military installation, as well as to preserve, maintain, and interpret the natural, seismic, cultural, and recreational heritage of the central Mississippi Valley region for the benefit, education, and inspiration of present and future generations of Americans.

(b) Boundaries.--The historical park shall consist of approximately 570 acres, including the real property transferred to the National Park Service at former Eaker Air Force Base under section 4 and the parcel of real property containing the archaeological site known as the Chickasawba Mound and authorized for acquisition under section 5. The boundaries of the historical park shall also include all property authorized to be acquired for inclusion in the park by any law enacted after the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. TRANSFER OF JURISDICTION, EAKER AIR FORCE BASE, FOR HISTORICAL PARK. (a) Transfer of Archaeological Sites.--The Secretary of Defense shall transfer, without reimbursement, to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior the parcels of real property (including improvements thereon) located at former Eaker Air Force Base, Blytheville, Arkansas, consisting of the archaeological sites depicted on the map entitled ``Arkansas Aeroplex Archaeological Sites''. (b) Visitor and Administrative Sites.-- (1) Transfer required.--To preserve the historical character and landscape of the main features of the historical park, the Secretary of Defense also shall transfer, without reimbursement, to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior an additional parcel of real property at former Eaker Air Force Base for the development of visitor, administrative, museum, curatorial, and maintenance facilities for the historical park. (2) Acreage limitation.--The parcel transferred under this subsection may not exceed 15 acres. (3) Selection.--The parcel to be transferred under this subsection shall be jointly selected by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Interior. (c) Use of Land.--The Secretary of the Interior shall use the real property transferred under this section as part of the historical park. (d) Legal Description.--The exact acreage and legal description of the real property to be transferred under this section shall be determined by a survey satisfactory to the Secretary of Defense. The cost of the survey shall be borne by the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 5. ACQUISITION OF CHICKASAWBA MOUND FOR INCLUSION IN HISTORICAL PARK. The Secretary of the Interior may acquire for inclusion in the historical park, by donation or exchange, the archaeological site known as the Chickasawba Mound, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATION OF HISTORICAL PARK.

The Congress find that-- (1) the Wisconsin State Legislature has passed legislation calling upon the Congress of the United States to provide for Federal establishment of benefit levels for aid to families with dependent children (AFDC); (2) the current variation in benefit levels from State to State has discouraged families receiving AFDC from remaining in their home communities, although it is generally in the best interest of all citizens to live close to their families, friends, and support networks, and where job opportunities exist, and decisions on where to live should not be complicated by the level of AFDC benefits; (3) under the current system, taxpayers in States are paying differing amounts, with some States providing comparatively more in AFDC benefits while others are paying well beneath the level of poverty; and (4) because poverty does not know State boundaries, and because of the current disparities in the system for both taxpayers and AFDC recipients, uniform AFDC benefits should be determined federally.

SECTION 1. REVISION OF TITLE XII. Title XII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8501 et seq.) is amended to read as follows: ``SEC. 12001. FINDINGS. ``The Congress finds the following: ``(1) There are 52,700,000 students in 88,223 elementary and secondary schools across the United States. The current Federal expenditure for education infrastructure is $12,000,000. The Federal expenditure per enrolled student for education infrastructure is 23 cents. An appropriation of $22,000,000,000 would result in a Federal expenditure for education infrastructure of $417 per student per fiscal year. ``(2) The General Accounting Office in 1995 reported that the Nation's elementary and secondary schools need approximately $112,000,000,000 to repair or upgrade facilities. Increased enrollments and continued building decay has raised this need to an estimated $200,000,000,000. Local education agencies, particularly those in central cities or those with high minority populations, cannot obtain adequate financial resources to complete necessary repairs or construction. These local education agencies face an annual struggle to meet their operating budgets. ``(3) According to a 1991 survey conducted by the American Association of School Administrators, 74 percent of all public school buildings need to be replaced. Almost one-third of such buildings were built prior to World War II. ``(4) The majority of the schools in unsatisfactory condition are concentrated in central cities and serve large populations of poor or minority students. ``(5) In the large cities of America, numerous schools still have polluting coal burning furnaces. Decaying buildings threaten the health, safety, and learning opportunities of students. A growing body of research has linked student achievement and behavior to the physical building conditions and overcrowding. Asthma and other respiratory illnesses exist in above average rates in areas of coal burning pollution. ``(6) According to a study conducted by the General Accounting Office in 1995, most schools are unprepared in critical areas for the 21st century. Most schools do not fully use modern technology and lack access to the information superhighway. Schools in central cities and schools with minority populations above 50 percent are more likely to fall short of adequate technology elements and have a greater number of unsatisfactory environmental conditions than other schools. ``(7) School facilities such as libraries and science laboratories are inadequate in old buildings and have outdated equipment. Frequently, in overcrowded schools, these same facilities are utilized as classrooms for an expanding school population. ``(8) Overcrowded classrooms have a dire impact on learning. Students in overcrowded schools score lower on both mathematics and reading exams than do students in schools with adequate space. In addition, overcrowding in schools negatively affects both classroom activities and instructional techniques. Overcrowding also disrupts normal operating procedures, such as lunch periods beginning as early as 10 a.m. and extending into the afternoon; teachers being unable to use a single room for an entire day; too few lockers for students, and jammed hallways and restrooms which encourage disorder and rowdy behavior. ``(9) School modernization for information technology is an absolute necessity for education for a coming CyberCivilization. The General Accounting Office has reported that many schools are not using modern technology and many students do not have access to facilities that can support education into the 21st century. It is imperative that we now view computer literacy as basic as reading, writing, and arithmetic. ``(10) Both the national economy and national security require an investment in school construction. Students educated in modern, safe, and well-equipped schools will contribute to the continued strength of the American economy and will ensure that our Armed Forces are the best trained and best prepared in the world. The shortage of qualified information technology workers continues to escalate and presently many foreign workers are being recruited to staff jobs in America. Military manpower shortages of personnel capable of operating high tech equipment are already acute in the Navy and increasing in other branches of the Armed Forces. ``SEC. 12002. PURPOSE. The purpose of this title is to provide Federal funds to enable local educational agencies to finance the costs associated with the construction, repair, and modernization for information technology of school facilities within their jurisdictions. ``SEC. 12003. FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF GRANTS. ``(a) Authority and Conditions for Grants.-- ``(1) In general.--To assist in the construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization for information technology of elementary and secondary schools, the Secretary shall make grants of funds to State educational agencies for the construction, reconstruction, or renovation, or for modernization for information technology, of such schools. ``(2) Formula for allocation.--From the amount appropriated under section 12006 for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allocate to each State an amount that bears the same ratio to such appropriated amount as the number of school-age children in such State bears to the total number of school-age children in all the States.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Medication Therapy Management Benefits Act of 2011''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Medications are important to the management of chronic diseases that require long-term or lifelong therapy. Pharmacists are uniquely qualified as medication experts to work with patients to manage their medications and chronic conditions and play a key role in helping patients take their medications as prescribed. (2) Nonadherence with medications is a significant problem. According to a report by the World Health Organization, in developed countries, only 50 percent of patients with chronic diseases adhere to medication therapies. For example, in the United States only 51 percent of patients taking blood pressure medications are adherent; similarly, only 40 to 70 percent of patients taking antidepressant medications adhere to prescribed therapies. (3) Failure to take medications as prescribed costs over $177 billion annually. The problem of nonadherence is particularly important for patients with chronic diseases that require use of medications; poor adherence leads to unnecessary disease progression, reduced functional status, lower quality of life, and premature death. (4) When patients adhere to, or comply with, their medication therapy, it is possible to reduce higher-cost medical attention, such as emergency department visits and catastrophic care, and avoid the preventable human costs that impact patients and those who care for them. (5) Studies have clearly demonstrated that community-based medication therapy management (MTM) services provided by pharmacists improve health care outcomes and reduce spending. For example, the Asheville Project--a diabetes program designed for city employees in Asheville, North Carolina, and delivered by community pharmacists--resulted over a 5-year period in a decrease in total direct medical costs ranging from $1,622 to $3,356 per patient per year, a 50 percent decrease in the use of sick days, and an increase in productivity accounting for an estimated savings of $18,000 annually. Another project involving pharmacist-provided care to patients with high cholesterol increased compliance with medication to 90 percent from a national average of 40 percent. In North Carolina, the ChecKmeds NC program, which offers eligible seniors one-on-one MTM consultations with pharmacists, saved an estimated $10,000,000 in healthcare costs and avoided numerous health problems in the first year of the program for the more than 15,000 seniors receiving MTM. Similar results have been achieved in several other demonstrations using community pharmacists. (6) Therefore, enhancement of the MTM benefit under part D of the Medicare program should be a key component of the national health care reform agenda. SEC. 3.

Summary:"," Sportsmen's Conservation and Outdoor Recreation Enhancement Act This bill reauthorizes several programs supporting the conservation of wildlife habitat. The bill amends the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act by extending until July 25, 2022, the Department of the Interior's authority to sell certain public land and use the proceeds from those sales for acquiring land located within or adjacent to federal lands. When prioritizing the acquisition of inholdings and nonfederal lands with exceptional resources, Interior and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) must consider the extent to which an acquisition of land would increase the public availability of resources for, and the public's access to, hunting, fishing, and other recreational activities. The bill also removes from the scope of the Act land that is eligible for sale under specified public land laws. The bill reauthorizes through FY2020 the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Act. The bill reauthorizes through FY2020 and revises the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act and the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act. Interior and USDA must ensure that specified amounts from the Land and Water Conservation Fund are made available each year for securing public access to federal land for hunting, fishing, and other recreational purposes through land transactions.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``At-Home Infant Care Act of 2004''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) In the majority of American families, parents, whether married or single, must work to provide economic security for their families and, not the least, for the infants newly welcomed into the family. Fifty-five percent of women with children less than 1 year of age are part of the workforce, while 73 percent of women with children 1 year of age or older are in the workforce. (2) Research shows that the quality and nature of care- taking in the first months and years of life are critical to a newborn's subsequent brain development, social development, and well-being. Healthy early development depends on nurturing and dependable relationships. (3) Research also shows that there is an extreme shortage of quality, affordable child care for infants. Numerous studies document lack of infant care and, in particular, affordable care that meets basic health and safety standards, particularly in rural areas. The current number of licensed infant slots can only meet 18 percent of the potential need. The shortage is even more acute in rural areas, especially those with a high percentage of low-wage residents. (4) For the well-being of American children, and for the economic security of the families on which they depend, working parents should be able to provide this care themselves without undermining family economic stability.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Limitation on Assistance to the Palestinian Authority Act of 2006''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) In fiscal year 2005, the United States provided $275 million to the West Bank and Gaza, of which $50 million was provided directly to the Palestinian Authority. (2) On January 25, 2006, the militant group Hamas, an organization designated by the Department of State as a foreign terrorist organization, won parliamentary elections and control of the Palestinian government. (3) The inclusion of Hamas or any other foreign terrorist organization in a Palestinian government is an implicit endorsement of anti-American and anti-Israeli terrorist ideology. (4) On December 16, 2005, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed House Resolution 575, which asserts that ``terrorist organizations, such as Hamas, should not be permitted to participate in Palestinian elections until such organizations recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, cease incitement, condemn terrorism, and permanently disarm and dismantle their terrorist infrastructure''. (5) House Resolution 575 further asserts that ``the inclusion of Hamas, or any other terrorist group on the Department of State's list of foreign terrorist organizations, in the Palestinian Authority's government will inevitably raise serious questions for the United States about the commitment of the Palestinian Authority and its leadership to making peace with Israel and will potentially undermine the ability of the United States to have a constructive relationship with, or provide further assistance to, the Palestinian Authority''. (6) Hamas is a terrorist organization that has killed more than 500 people since 1989, including more than two dozen United States citizens. (7) The United States has clearly stated that armed militias attached to political parties are incompatible with democratic societies. SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY. It shall be the policy of the United States to promote the emergence of a democratic Palestinian government that-- (1) denounces and combats terrorism; (2) is actively working to disarm and dismantle terrorist agencies, networks, and facilities; (3) is actively working to eliminate terrorist incitement and the commemoration of terrorists in Palestinian society; (4) respects the boundaries and sovereignty of its neighbors; (5) recognizes the existence of Israel and its right to secure borders; and (6) acknowledges, respects, and upholds the human rights of all people. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. Chapter 1 of part III of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2351 et seq.) is amended-- (1) by redesignating the second section 620G (as added by section 149 of Public Law 104-164 (110 Stat. 1436)) as section 620J; and (2) by adding at the end the following new section: ``SEC. 620K. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. ``(a) Limitation.--Assistance may be provided under this Act or any other provision of law to the Palestinian Authority only during a period for which a certification described in subsection (b) is in effect. ``(b) Certification.--A certification described in this subsection is a certification transmitted by the President to Congress that contains a determination of the President that-- ``(1) the Palestinian Authority is not controlled by a foreign terrorist organization; and ``(2) the Palestinian Authority-- ``(A) recognizes the right of Israel to exist; ``(B) disarms all militias; ``(C) renounces violence and acts of terrorism against Israel; and ``(D) takes definitive steps to be an active and willing participant in peace negotiations and removes people with ties to terrorist organizations from its security services. ``(c) Recertifications.--Not later than 90 days after the date on which the President transmits to Congress an initial certification under subsection (b), and every 6 months thereafter-- ``(1) the President shall transmit to Congress a recertification that the requirements contained in subsection (b) are continuing to be met; or ``(2) if the President is unable to make such a recertification, the President shall transmit to Congress a report that contains the reasons therefor. ``(d) Congressional Notification.--Assistance made available under this Act or any other provision of law to the Palestinian Authority may not be provided until 15 days after the date on which the President has provided notice thereof to the Committee on International Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate in accordance with the procedures applicable to reprogramming notifications under section 634A(a) of this Act. ``(e) Definitions.--In this section: ``(1) Foreign terrorist organization.--The term `foreign terrorist organization' means an organization designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State in accordance with section 219(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189(a)). ``(2) Palestinian authority.--The term `Palestinian Authority' includes any agency or instrumentality of the Palestinian Authority.''.

Summary:"," Limitation on Assistance to the Palestinian Authority Act of 2006 - States that it shall be US policy to promote the emergence of a democratic Palestinian government that: (1) denounces and combats terrorism. (2) is actively working to disarm and dismantle terrorist agencies, networks, and facilities.

SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Within hours after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the Imperial Japanese forces launched an attack on the Philippines, cutting off vital lines of communication to United States and Filipino troops assigned to the United States Army Forces in the Far East under the command of General Douglas MacArthur. (2) On December 8th, 1941, the 200th Coast Artillery Regiment, successors to the New Mexico National Guardsmen who made up part of the famed ``Rough Riders'' of the Spanish- American War, were the ``first to fire''. (3) Despite being cut off from supply lines and reinforcements, the United States and Philippine Forces quickly executed a plan to delay the Japanese invasion and defend the Philippines against the Japanese invasion. (4) By April 1942, troops from the United States and the Philippines had bravely and staunchly fought off enemy attacks in Bataan for more than 4 months under strenuous conditions that resulted in widespread starvation and disease. (5) By maintaining their position and engaging the enemy for as long as they did, the troops at Bataan were able to redefine the momentum of the war, delaying the Japanese timetable to take control of the southeast Pacific for needed war materials. Because of the Bataan defenders' heroic actions, United States and Allied forces throughout the Pacific had time to regroup and prepare for the successful liberation of the Pacific and the Philippines. (6) On April 9, 1942, Major General Edward King, his troops suffering from starvation and a lack of supplies, surrendered the soldiers from the United States and the Philippines into enemy hands. (7) Over the next week, troops from the United States and the Philippines were taken prisoner and forced to march 65 miles without any food, water, or medical care in what came to be known as the ``Bataan Death March''. (8) During this forced march, thousands of soldiers died, either from starvation, lack of medical care, sheer exhaustion, or abuse by their captors. (9) Conditions at the prisoner of war camps were appalling, leading to increased disease and malnutrition among the prisoners. (10) The prisoners at Camp O'Donnell would die at a rate of nearly 400 per day because of its poor conditions. (11) On June 6, 1942, the prisoners from the United States were transferred to Camp Cabanatuan, north of Camp O'Donnell. (12) Nearly 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino Prisoners of War died at Camp O'Donnell, and survivors were gradually paroled from September through December 1942. (13) Between September of 1942 and December of 1944, American prisoners of war who survived the horrific death march were shipped north for forced labor aboard ``hell ships'' and succumbed in great numbers because of the abysmal conditions. Many of the ships were mistakenly targeted by allied Naval forces because the Japanese military convoys were not properly labeled as carrying prisoners of war. The sinking of the Arisan Maru alone, claimed nearly 1,800 American lives. (14) The prisoners who remained in the camps suffered from continued mistreatment, malnutrition, lack of medical care, and horrific conditions until they were liberated in 1945. (15) The veterans of Bataan represented the best of America and the Philippines. They hailed from diverse locales across both countries and represented a true diversity of Americans. (16) Over the subsequent decades, these prisoners formed support groups, were honored in local and State memorials, and told their story to all people of the United States. (17) The United States Navy has continued to honor their history and stories by naming 2 ships after the battle including 1 ship still in service, USS Bataan (LHD-5), in memory of their valor and honorable resistance against Imperial Japanese forces. (18) Many of the survivors of Bataan have now passed away, and those who remain continue to tell their story. (19) The people of the United States and the Philippines are forever indebted to these men for-- (A) the courage and tenacity they demonstrated during the first 4 months of World War II fighting against enemy soldiers; and (B) the perseverance they demonstrated during 3 years of capture, imprisonment, and atrocious conditions, while maintaining dignity, honor, patriotism, and loyalty. SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf of the Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design in honor of the troops from the United States and the Philippines who defended Bataan and were subsequently prisoners of war, collectively, in recognition of their personal sacrifice and service to their country during World War II. (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the award under subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary. (c) Smithsonian Institution.-- (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in honor of the defenders and prisoners of war at Bataan under subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given to the Smithsonian Institution, where it shall be displayed as appropriate and made available for research. (2) Sense of the congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal received under paragraph (1) available for display at other locations, particularly such locations as are associated with the prisoners of war at Bataan. SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS. (a) Striking of Duplicates.--Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may strike duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under section 2. (b) Selling of Duplicates.--The Secretary may sell such duplicates under subsection (a) at a price sufficient to cover the costs of such duplicates, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses. SEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS. Medals struck pursuant to this Act are National medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS; PROCEEDS OF SALE. (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund, an amount not to exceed $30,000 to pay for the cost of the medal authorized under section 2. (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of duplicate bronze medals under section 3 shall be deposited in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.

Summary:"," Authorizes the award of a single Congressional Gold Medal to collectively honor the troops from the United States and the Philippines who defended Bataan, Philippines, and were subsequently prisoners of war, in recognition of their personal sacrifice and service to their country during World War II.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Chronic Wasting Disease State Support Act of 2002''. SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE. In this Act, the term ``chronic wasting disease'' means the animal disease afflicting deer and elk that-- (1) is a transmissible disease of the nervous system resulting in distinctive lesions in the brain; and (2) belongs to the group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which group includes scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the States retain undisputed primacy and policy-making authority with regard to wildlife management, and nothing in this Act interferes with or otherwise affects the primacy of the States in managing wildlife generally, or managing, surveying, and monitoring the incidence of chronic wasting disease. (2) Chronic wasting disease, the fatal neurological disease found in cervids, is a fundamental threat to the health and vibrancy of deer and elk populations, and the increased occurrence of chronic wasting disease in regionally diverse locations in recent months necessitates an escalation in research, surveillance, monitoring, and management activities focused on containing, managing, and eradicating this lethal disease. (3) As the States move to manage existing incidence of chronic wasting disease and insulate non-infected wild and captive cervid populations from the disease, the Federal Government should endeavor to provide integrated and holistic financial and technical support to these States. (4) In its statutory role as supporting agent, relevant Federal agencies should provide consistent, coherent, and integrated support structures and programs for the benefit of State wildlife and agricultural administrators, as chronic wasting disease can move freely between captive and wild cervids across the broad array of Federal, State, and local land management jurisdictions. (5) The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and other affected Federal authorities can provide consistent, coherent, and integrated support systems under existing legal authorities.

(2) The lands occupied by the Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity were originally the ancestral lands of both the Zuni Tribe and the Navajo Nation, as indicated by tribal ancestral histories and the large number of archeological and cultural sites identified on the lands. (3) The Secretary of the Interior, with the support of the Zuni Tribe, the Navajo Nation, and other concerned parties, determined that, upon completion of environmental remediation of Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity, lands no longer needed by the Department of the Army would be transferred to the Secretary of the Interior and held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Zuni Tribe and the Navajo Nation. (4) On July 8, 2013, the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation, acting through their respective tribal leadership, who received authority from their tribal governments to enter into good faith discussions, and through their respective legal representatives, met in the Capitol office of Congressman Don Young, with Congressman Ben Ray Lujan and Congressman Steve Pearce present, for final discussions to fairly divide Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity. (5) In the resulting discussions, the tribal leaders informally agreed to the property divisions reflected in the map titled ``Fort Wingate Depot Activity Negotiated Property Division July 2013'' prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers (in this Act referred to as the ``Map''), and the land division outlined in section 3 was created in consultation with the Zuni Tribe and the Navajo Nation.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Change Education Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) The evidence for human-induced climate change is overwhelming and undeniable. (2) Atmospheric carbon can be significantly reduced through conservation, by shifting to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal, and by increasing the efficiency of buildings, including domiciles, and transportation. (3) Providing clear information about climate change, in a variety of forms, can remove the fear and the sense of helplessness, and encourage individuals and communities to take action. (4) Implementation of measures that promote energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy will greatly reduce human impact on the environment. (5) Informing people of new technologies and programs as they become available will ensure maximum understanding and maximum effect of those measures.
