{"prompt":"SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Taxpayer's Right To View Act of 1993''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The Federal Communications Commission predicts a diminished role for broadcast television and a more prominent role for cable television including pay-per-view. (2) Roughly 18,800,000 American homes are equipped to receive pay-per-view and this number is expected to increase to 35,900,000 by 1996. Overall pay-per-view revenue is expected to reach $1,100,000,000 by 1996. (3) There is a growing trend toward making events available exclusively on pay-per-view. (4) As this trend develops, whether the consumer has access to these events will be determined by the ability of the consumer to pay. (5) Professional sports leagues are beginning to see pay- per-view as a new revenue source to keep pace with escalating player salaries. (6) As a result, some media analysts predict that several of broadcast television's premier sports attractions eventually will migrate to pay-per-view. (7) Limited access to viewing such events as the ``Super Bowl'' or ``World Series'' would deprive citizens of the ability to enjoy these events which are inherent in the American tradition. (8) The majority of facilities in which such events are held are funded through taxpayer money. (9) It is unfair that taxpayers, who subsidize the construction and maintenance of many of these facilities, should have to pay an additional pay-per-view charge for viewing these events. (10) Nonprofit and public organizations including public and private educational institutions and their athletic organizations are exempt from the corporate income tax. (11) Furthermore, corporations can deduct their donations to college sporting events as charitable contributions. (12) Tax exempt status is granted to these nonprofit and public organizations by the Federal Government and it is unfair to allow those who use this status to engage in pay-per-view telecasting--thus forcing taxpayers to pay again. (13) It is unfair that taxpayers, who subsidize the construction and maintenance of many of these facilities, should have to pay an additional pay-per-view charge for viewing these events. (14) Therefore, Congress should ensure that all taxpaying citizens have free access to events that are sponsored by organizations with nonprofit tax exempt status and those events held in taxpayer subsidized facilities. SEC. 3. PAY-PER-VIEW CHARGES PROHIBITED. Section 623 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 543) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection: ``(i)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, a cable operator may not assess or collect any separate charges for any video programming of a sporting, theatrical, or other entertainment event if that event is performed at a facility constructed, renovated, or maintained with tax revenues or by an organization that receives public financial support. ``(2) The Commission and local franchising authorities are authorized to make determinations concerning the applicability of the prohibition contained in paragraph (1). In making such determinations-- ``(A) a facility shall be considered to have been constructed, maintained, or renovated with tax revenues if-- ``(i) tax exempt financing was used to construct, maintain, or renovate the facility, ``(ii) the facility was constructed on land donated by a government, or leased by a government at below market rates, or ``(iii) public infrastructure or public service for the facility are provided by the government at below market rates, with the exception of police, fire, and rescue services; ``(B) an event is performed by a nonprofit or public organization that receives tax subsidies if the event is sponsored by, or includes the participation of a team that is a part of, an organization-- ``(i) that is exempt from Federal income taxes under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or ``(ii) that is exempt from Federal income taxes under section 115 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and to which donations are tax deductible under such Code; and ``(C) notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a facility shall not be considered to have been constructed with tax revenues if the government has been reimbursed, through the proceeds of a sale of the facility or otherwise, for the total amount of the tax revenues that were used to construct the facility, as determined under subparagraph (A), but in this section shall be construed to exempt facilities from this subsection if the facility is receiving current financial support. ``(3) The Commission shall prescribe, by regulation, procedures for the administration of this subsection.''.\n\nSummary:","completion":" Taxpayer's Right to View Act of 1993 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a cable operator from assessing separate charges for any video programming of a sporting, theatrical, or other entertainment event if that event is performed at a facility constructed, renovated, or maintained with tax revenues or by an organization that receives public financial support.

{"prompt":"FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The goal of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) is to maintain marine mammal species and population stocks at their optimum sustainable populations. (2) If the annual removals of individuals of a species or population stock of marine mammals do not exceed the potential biological removal level, the species or population stock will be maintained at, or reach, its optimum sustainable population. (3) Requiring that commercial fishermen achieve a zero mortality rate goal for a species or population stock of marine mammals that is equal to or less than 10 percent of the potential biological removal of a given marine mammal species or population stock is unnecessary to achieve that Act's goal of maintaining species and stocks at their optimum sustainable population and penalizes commercial fishermen. (4) The Congress intended that the zero mortality rate goal under that Act would be met if fishermen use the best technology that is economically and technologically feasible. (5) Species and populations stocks of marine mammal that have reached historic levels are impeding the recovery of endangered species and threatened species through predation or competition in the ecosystem. (6) The fundamental principles of ecosystem management are defeated by giving one species a preeminent position in the ecosystem through, imposition of a zero mortality rate goal. (7) All persons that interact with marine mammals should seek to reduce and eliminate marine mammal injuries and mortalities through the use of the best equipment and techniques that are economically and technologically feasible. SEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF GOALS FOR REDUCING INCIDENTAL TAKE OF MARINE MAMMALS IN COMMERCIAL FISHING. (a) Repeal of Zero Mortality Goal.--Section 118 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1387) is amended by striking subsection (b), and by redesignating subsections (c) through (l) in order as subsections (b) through (k).

{"prompt":"SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Education and Training for Health Act of 2017'' or the ``EAT for Health Act of 2017''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) According to 2013 national health expenditure data, United States health care spending increased 3.6 percent to reach $2.9 trillion, or $9,255 per person, and accounted for 17.4 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). (2) According to the Institute of Medicine, in 2012 estimates of health care costs attributed over 75 percent of national health expenditures to treatment for chronic diseases. (3) A March 2003 report from the World Health Organization concluded diet was a major cause of chronic diseases. (4) Seven out of 10 deaths among people in the United States each year are from chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. (5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 heart disease was the leading cause of death for American adults. Approximately 600,000 American adults die each year from cardiovascular disease. Coronary heart disease alone costs American taxpayers $108.9 billion each year. (6) Research has shown that following a healthful diet can not only reduce symptoms related to cardiovascular disease but can also actually reverse damage done to the arteries. (7) According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, two-thirds of adults in the United States are currently overweight, and half of those overweight individuals are obese. One in three children are overweight, and one-fifth of children are obese. The United States spends about $147 to $210 billion a year on obesity related diseases, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and arthritis. (8) An estimated 29.1 million people in the United States have diabetes. Another 86 million American adults have prediabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts that one in three children born in 2000 will develop diabetes at some point in their lives. Total estimated costs of diagnosed diabetes have increased 41 percent, to $245 billion in 2012 from $174 billion in 2007. (9) According to the American Cancer Society, there will be an estimated 1,658,370 new cancer cases diagnosed and 589,430 cancer deaths in the United States in 2015. That is equivalent to about 1,620 deaths per day and accounts for nearly 1 of every 4 deaths. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) estimates that the direct medical costs for cancer in the United States in 2011 were $88.7 billion. (10) According to the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, in 2008 physicians felt inadequately trained to provide proper nutrition advice. Ninety-four percent felt nutrition counseling should be included during primary care visits, but only 14 percent felt adequately trained to provide such counseling. (11) A 1985 National Academy of Sciences report recommended that all medical schools require at least 25 contact hours of nutrition education. According to a 2009 national survey of medical colleges published in Academic Medicine, only 38 percent of medical schools met these minimum standards by requiring 25 hours of nutrition education as part of their general curricula in 2004. By 2010, that number had shrunk to 27 percent. In addition, 30 percent of United States medical schools required a dedicated nutrition course in 2004. Most recently, only 25 percent of such schools required such a course in 2010. (12) According to the Journal of Nutrition in Clinical Practice in 2010, more than half of graduating medical students felt their nutrition education was insufficient. (13) Recognizing the importance of nutrition, Healthy People 2020--the Federal Government's framework for a healthier Nation--includes a goal (NWS-6) to increase the proportion of physician office visits that include counseling or education related to nutrition or weight. According to Healthy People 2020, only 13.8 percent of physician office visits included counseling about nutrition or diet (2010 latest year available). (14) According to Mission: Readiness, one in four Americans cannot serve in the military due to weight. For those serving, the military discharged 4,300 active-duty personnel due to weight problems in 2012.
