The Congress finds as follows: (1) Immigration is a Federal responsibility. (2) The Immigration and Naturalization Service does not take into custody all aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States. (3) Section 1867 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395dd) and State laws require that, if any individual (whether or not lawfully present in the United States) comes to a hospital and the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide either, within the staff and facilities available at the hospital, for such further medical examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition, or, if appropriate, for transfer of the individual to another medical facility. (4) The Southwest border region is ill-equipped to absorb the expense of providing health care to undocumented aliens because it ranks last in the country in terms of per capita income. (5) The Southwest border region has been designated as a health professional shortage area under section 332 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e).

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Persian Gulf War Illness Compensation Act of 2001''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Although the majority of veterans of the Armed Forces who served in the Persian Gulf War returned from the Southwest Asia theater of operations to normal activities, many of those veterans have experienced a range of unexplained illnesses, including chronic fatigue, muscle and joint pain, loss of concentration, forgetfulness, headache, and rash. (2) Those veterans were potentially exposed during that war to a wide range of biological and chemical agents, including sand, smoke from oil-well fires, paints, solvents, insecticides, petroleum fuels and their combustion products, organophosphate nerve agents, pyridostigmine bromide, depleted uranium, anthrax and botulinum toxoid vaccinations, and infectious diseases, in addition to other psychological and physiological stresses. (3) Section 1117 of title 38, United States Code, enacted on November 2, 1994, by the Persian Gulf War Veterans' Benefits Act (title I of Public Law 103-446), provides for the payment of compensation to Persian Gulf veterans suffering from a chronic disability resulting from an undiagnosed illness (or combination of undiagnosed illnesses) that became manifest to a compensable degree within a period prescribed by regulation. (4) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs prescribed regulations under section 1117 of title 38, United States Code, that interpreted that section so as to limit compensation to Persian Gulf veterans with illnesses that ``cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis''. (5) In a report dated September 7, 2000, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences indicated that it was not asked to determine whether an identifiable medical syndrome referred to as ``Gulf War Syndrome'' exists and suggested that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in developing a compensation program for Persian Gulf veterans, consider the health effects that may be associated with exposures to specific agents that were present in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War.

(b) Undiagnosed Illnesses.--Such section, as amended by subsection (a), is further amended by inserting after subsection (a) the following new subsection (b): ``(b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term `undiagnosed illness' means illness manifested by symptoms or signs the cause, etiology, or origin of which cannot be specifically and definitely identified, including poorly defined illnesses such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune disorder, and multiple chemical sensitivity. The attribution of one or more of the symptoms to a disability that is not an undiagnosed illness shall not preclude other symptoms from being considered a manifestation of an undiagnosed illness. ``(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), signs or symptoms that may be a manifestation of an undiagnosed illness include the following: ``(A) Fatigue. ``(B) Unexplained rashes or other dermatological signs or symptoms. ``(C) Headache. ``(D) Muscle pain. ``(E) Joint pain. ``(F) Neurologic signs or symptoms. ``(G) Neuropsychological signs or symptoms. ``(H) Signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or lower). ``(I) Sleep disturbances. ``(J) Gastrointestinal signs or symptoms. ``(K) Cardiovascular signs or symptoms. ``(L) Abnormal weight loss. ``(M) Menstrual disorders.''.

(2) The second sentence of section 5110(g) of title 38, United States Code, shall not apply in the case of an award, or increased award, of compensation pursuant to the amendments made by this section if the date of application therefor is not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSummary:","completion":" Persian Gulf War Illness Compensation Act of 2001 - Amends a veterans' benefits program of compensation for disabilities occurring in veterans of the Persian Gulf War to: (1) require such disabilities, to be compensable, to occur before December 31, 2011, or such later date as prescribed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

EXCEPTION AND SAFE HARBOR FROM FEDERAL SANCTIONS FOR INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FROM HOSPITALS TO PHYSICIANS UNDER CERTAIN INCENTIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The Department of Health and Human Services has been engaged in approving, on a project-by-project basis, gain- sharing arrangements under demonstration authority for nearly a decade. Based on the knowledge gained from such demonstration projects, the Department is capable of developing and applying standards for permitting such arrangements more generally without the use of such authority. (2) The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services has issued a special advisory bulletin in July 1999 that indicates that there is no general authority for waiving sanctions for any gain-sharing arrangements between physicians and hospitals. (3) Due to lack of capitalization, size limitations, risk characteristics, and other factors, many hospitals and physicians have been unable or unwilling to enter into gain- sharing types of arrangements that meet the requirements of the shared savings program. (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish general statutory authority within the Department of Health and Human Services to recognize gain-sharing and other incentive payment programs, other than the shared savings program, that align incentives among hospitals and physicians to improve efficiency and decrease costs while maintaining or improving quality care. (c) Exception From Physician Self-Referral Prohibition.--Section 1877(e) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395nn(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph: ``(9) Payments under certain incentive payment programs between hospitals and physicians.-- ``(A) In general.--In the case of a monetary incentive payment which is made by a hospital to a physician under an incentive payment program (as defined in subparagraph (B)) that meets requirements established by the Secretary in consultation with the Attorney General and the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services for purposes of this paragraph. ``(B) Incentive payment program defined.--In this paragraph, the term `incentive payment program' means a program that is designed to align incentives among hospitals and physicians (through techniques such as product standardization, the substitution of lower cost products, and care coordination initiatives that encourage medically appropriate decreases in length of stay) to improve efficiency and decrease costs while maintaining or improving quality.''. (d) Safe Harbor From Antikickback and Other Federal Sanctions.-- (1) Section 1128B(b)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)(3)) is amended-- (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (I); (B) in subparagraph (J), by moving the indentation 2 ems to the left and by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(K) any monetary incentive payment which is made by a hospital to a physician under an incentive payment program (as defined in subparagraph (B) of section 1877(e)(9)) that meets requirements established by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services in consultation with the Attorney General for purposes of applying this subparagraph (which requirements needs not be the same as those established under subparagraph (A) of such section).''.

(3) This policy provided the people of the United States with insight into who influences the White House and transparency regarding efforts by lobbyists to effect policies, legislation, and Presidential actions. (4) To date, the Trump administration has not indicated whether it will continue the policy of publicly releasing White House visitor access records. (5) Since taking office on January 20, 2017, President Trump has conducted official business not only in the White House, but also at several of his privately owned clubs and resorts. (6) President Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, has been dubbed the ``Winter White House'' and the ``Southern White House''. (7) President Trump has spent 5 of his first 9 weekends in office at Mar-a-Lago. (8) Mar-a-Lago is a private membership facility open to members, their guests, and others who have been invited as guests for special events. (9) Visitors to Mar-a-Lago do not undergo the same background checks as White House visitors and visitor access records to the club have not been released to the public. (10) The President has conducted official business and hosted international leaders at Mar-a-Lago. (11) Media reports have shown President Trump and members of his Cabinet at Mar-a-Lago and nearby Trump International Golf Club interacting with members and guests, providing access unavailable to the general public. (12) President Trump owns many other properties that offer similar amenities and membership-only access where he is likely to conduct official business during his term in office. (13) On March 11, 2017, President Trump hosted several members of his Cabinet at his Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, to discuss homeland security, health care, and the economy according to media reports. (14) Media reports have indicated that the President may use his Bedminster, New Jersey, resort as a ``Summer White House''. (15) The people of the United States expect and deserve transparency in government. The policy to release visitor access records instituted by the previous administration appropriately balanced transparency with the need for confidentiality in government actions. (16) To the extent Mar-a-Lago and any other private facilities become locations where the President conducts business and interacts with individuals who are not government officials, the same disclosures should apply. SEC. 3. IMPROVING ACCESS TO INFLUENTIAL VISITOR ACCESS RECORDS.

The Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the organization of the militia of the District of Columbia'', approved March 1, 1889 (sec. 49--101 et seq., D.C. Official Code) is amended by adding at the end the following new title: ``TITLE II--EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ``SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. ``(a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the `Major General David F. Wherley, Jr. District of Columbia National Guard Retention and College Access Act'. ``(b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: ``(1) The District of Columbia National Guard is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the President of the United States as Commander-in-Chief and, unlike other National Guards, is permanently federalized. ``(2) The District of Columbia National Guard is unique and differs from the National Guards of the several States in that the District of Columbia National Guard is responsible, not only for residents of the District of Columbia, but also for a special and unique mission and obligation as a result of the extensive presence of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia. ``(3) Consequently, the President of the United States, rather than the chief executive of the District of Columbia, is in command of the District of Columbia National Guard, and only the President can call up the District of Columbia National Guard even for local emergencies. ``(4) The District of Columbia National Guard has been specifically trained to address the unique emergencies that may occur regarding the presence of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia. ``(5) The great majority of the members of the District of Columbia National Guard actually live in Maryland or Virginia, rather than in the District of Columbia. ``(6) The District of Columbia National Guard has been experiencing a disproportionate decline in force in comparison to the National Guards of Maryland and Virginia. ``(7) The States of Maryland and Virginia provide additional recruiting and retention incentives, such as educational benefits, in order to maintain their force, and their National Guards have drawn recruits from the District of Columbia at a rate that puts at risk the maintenance of the necessary force levels for the District of Columbia National Guard. ``(8) Funds for an educational benefit for members of the District of Columbia National Guard would provide an incentive to help reverse the loss of members to nearby National Guards and allow for maintenance and increase of necessary District of Columbia National Guard personnel. ``(9) The loss of members of the District of Columbia National Guard could adversely affect the readiness of the District of Columbia National Guard to respond in the event of a terrorist attack on the capital of the United States. ``SEC. 202.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act of 2005''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: (1) The development of uterine fibroids is a common and significant health problem, affecting women, primarily of reproductive age, across all ages, racial backgrounds, and socioeconomic levels. (2) It is estimated that between 20 and 30 percent of women of reproductive age have clinically recognized uterine fibroids, and screening studies indicate the prevalence of uterine fibroids in women may be much higher. (3) Minority women are more likely to develop uterine fibroids, and through ultrasound screening of African American and Caucasian women for fibroids, it is estimated that more than 80 percent of African Americans and about 70 percent of Caucasians develop fibroids by the time they reach menopause and the tumors develop at younger ages in African Americans. (4) Symptomatic uterine fibroids can cause heavy bleeding, pain, and reproductive problems, including infertility. There is no known cause of uterine fibroids. (5) The presence of uterine fibroids is the most common reason for hysterectomies, accounting for approximately one- third of hysterectomies, or 200,000 procedures annually and 22 percent of African American women and 7 percent of Caucasians have hysterectomies for fibroids. (6) Over five billion dollars are spent annually on hysterectomies, at approximately $6,000 for each surgery. (7) The Evidence Report and Summary on the Management of Uterine Fibroids, as compiled by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of the Department of Health and Human Services, held that there is a ``remarkable lack of high quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of most interventions for symptomatic fibroids''.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: (1) Congress supports the goals of Indian self- determination and economic development. (2) Congress supports the efforts of Indian tribes to promote their economic development efforts, wherever possible, in cooperation with State and local governments and others. (3) The Puyallup tribe, a signatory to the 1854 Treaty of Medicine Creek, has a reservation in Washington State. (4) The Puyallup tribe, which operates gaming facilities pursuant to a compact with the State of Washington, is a significant source of jobs in the area of Tacoma, Washington. (5) The Port of Tacoma is an independent, municipal corporation that operates under State enabling legislation. (6) The Port of Tacoma is also a significant source of jobs in the area of Tacoma, Washington. (7) The Port of Tacoma is in the process of expanding its operations to provide greater economic opportunities for the City of Tacoma, Pierce County, and the State of Washington. (8) The Port of Tacoma's expansion requires the closure of the primary access road for one of the Puyallup tribe's gaming operations. Without this access road, the Puyallup tribe's gaming facility will no longer be economically viable at its current location. To avoid economic dislocation, including for the employees of the current facility, the Puyallup tribe has identified land on the Puyallup Reservation that would provide a suitable substitute location for its gaming facility. (9) The Puyallup tribe, as a result of the Port of Tacoma's road closure, seeks to have certain land taken into trust within its reservation. (10) The Puyallup tribe has worked closely and cooperatively with all affected entities, and the State of Washington, Pierce County, the City of Tacoma, the City of Fife, and the Port of Tacoma all support the Puyallup tribe in connection with this trust land acquisition.

(2) Qualified tradeable renewable energy credits. (b) Qualification of Offsets and Credits.--A tradeable greenhouse gas offset or renewable energy credit shall be treated as qualified for purposes of this section if the Secretary of Energy certifies the generator of such offset or credit. Upon the application of any person generating or planning to generate any such offsets or credits, the Secretary shall certify the generator if the Secretary determines that the generator meets, or will, upon implementation, meet, such requirements as the Secretary deems necessary, under rules promulgated by the Secretary, to ensure that the offsets or credits generated will represent the reduction of greenhouse gases as specified or estimated in the offset (in the case of an offset) or in the generation of the amount of renewable energy which the credit represents or is estimated to represent (in the case of a credit). A reduction in greenhouse gases that the Secretary determines would have occurred in the absence of the opportunity to sell an offset for such reduction shall not be treated as a qualified offset for purposes of this Act. (c) Approval of Open Market Transactions.--The Secretary of Energy shall promulgate rules, after notice and opportunity for comment, regarding the open market transactions (involving qualified tradeable greenhouse gas offsets and qualified tradeable renewable energy credits) that will be treated as approved for purposes of this Act.

(3) Renewable energy credit.--The term ``renewable energy credit'' means all of the environmental attributes associated with a single unit of energy generated by a renewable energy source where: (A) those attributes are transferred or recorded separately from that unit of energy; (B) the party claiming ownership of the credit has acquired the exclusive legal ownership of all, and not less than all, the environmental attributes associated with that unit of energy; and (C) exclusive legal ownership of the credit can be verified and approved by the Secretary through an auditable contract path or other system established by the Secretary. (4) Renewable energy.--The term ``renewable energy'' means electric energy generated from solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, ocean (including tidal, wave, current, and thermal), geothermal, municipal solid waste, or new hydroelectric generation capacity achieved from increased efficiency or additions of new capacity at an existing hydroelectric project. (5) Tradeable.--The term ``tradeable'' when used in connection with an offset or credit means that the offset or credit is available for purchase and sale in an open and transparent market.

(2) Seek to ensure that political or religious views, sex, ethnic or national background, involvement in political activities or nonviolent demonstrations, or association with suspected or known dissidents will not prohibit hiring, lead to harassment, demotion, or dismissal, or in any way affect the status or terms of employment in the industrial cooperation project. The United States national should not discriminate in terms or conditions of employment in the industrial cooperation project against persons with past records of arrests or internal exile for nonviolent protest or membership in unofficial organizations committed to nonviolence.

(8) Discourage or undertake to prevent compulsory political indoctrination programs from taking place on the premises of the operations of the industrial cooperation project. (9) Promote freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any media. To this end, the United States national should raise with appropriate authorities of the Government of the People's Republic of China concerns about restrictions on importation of foreign publications.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Liability Reform Act of 2007''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds that-- (1) the defects in the United States civil justice system have a direct and undesirable effect on interstate commerce by decreasing the availability of goods and services in commerce; (2) the spiraling costs of litigation and the magnitude and unpredictability of punitive damage awards and noneconomic damage awards have continued unabated for at least the past 30 years; (3) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized that a punitive damage award can be unconstitutional if the award is grossly excessive in relation to the legitimate interest of the government in the punishment and deterrence of unlawful conduct; (4) just as punitive damage awards can be grossly excessive, so can it be grossly excessive in some circumstances for a party to be held responsible under the doctrine of joint and several liability for damages that party did not cause; (5) as a result of joint and several liability, entities including small businesses are often brought into litigation despite the fact that their conduct may have little or nothing to do with the accident or transaction giving rise to the lawsuit, and may therefore face increased and unjust costs due to the possibility or result of unfair and disproportionate damage awards; (6) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation costs, small businesses face higher costs in purchasing insurance through interstate insurance markets to cover their activities; and (7) legislation to address these concerns is an appropriate exercise of the powers of Congress under clauses 3, 9, and 18 of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States, and the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Dog and Cat Protection Act of 1999''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) An estimated 2,000,000 dogs and cats are slaughtered and sold annually as part of the international fur trade. Internationally, dog and cat fur is used in a wide variety of products, including fur coats and jackets, fur-trimmed garments, hats, gloves, decorative accessories, stuffed animals, and other toys. (2) As demonstrated by forensic tests, dog and cat fur products are being imported into the United States, in some cases with deceptive labeling to conceal the use of dog or cat fur. (3) Dog and cat fur, when dyed, is not easily distinguishable to persons who are not experts from other furs such as fox, rabbit, coyote, wolf, and mink. Dog and cat fur is generally less expensive than other types of fur and may be used as a substitute for more expensive types of furs. (4) Foreign fur producers use dogs and cats bred for their fur, and also use strays and stolen pets. (5) The methods of housing, transporting, and slaughtering dogs and cats for fur production are generally unregulated and inhumane. (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are-- (1) to prohibit the sale, manufacture, offer for sale, transportation, and distribution in the United States of dog and cat fur products; (2) to require accurate labeling of fur species so that consumers in the United States can make informed choices; and (3) to prohibit the trade in, both imports and exports of, dog and cat fur products, to ensure that the United States market does not encourage the slaughter of dogs or cats for their fur, and to ensure that the purposes of this Act are not undermined.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Detaining Terrorists to Secure America Act of 2011'' SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following finding: (1) The United States and its international partners are in an armed conflict with violent Islamist extremist groups, including al Qaeda and associated terrorist organizations, that are committed to killing Americans and our allies. (2) In the last 2 years, terrorists have repeatedly attempted to kill Americans both here at home and abroad, including the following attacks, plots, or alleged plots and attacks: (A) A September 2009 plot by Najibullah Zazi--who received training from al Qaeda in Pakistan--to conduct a suicide bomb attack on the New York, New York, subway system. (B) A November 2009 attack by Nidal Malik Hasan at Fort Hood, Texas, that killed 13 people and wounded 32. (C) A Christmas Day 2009 attempt by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to detonate a bomb sewn into his underwear on an international flight to Detroit, Michigan. (D) A May 2010 attempt by Faisal Shahzad to bomb Times Square in New York, New York, on a crowded Saturday evening, an attack that was unsuccessful only because the car bomb failed to detonate. (E) An October 2010 attempt by terrorists in Yemen to send, via commercial cargo flights, 2 packages of explosives to Jewish centers in Chicago, Illinois. (F) A February 2011 plot by Khaled Aldawsari, a Saudi-born student, to manufacture explosives and potentially attack New York, New York, the Dallas, Texas, home of former President George W. Bush, as well as hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants, and a nightclub. (3) Since the September 11, 2001, attacks on our Nation, the United States and allied forces have captured thousands of individuals fighting for or supporting al Qaeda and associated terrorist organizations that do not abide by the law of war, including detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who served as planners of those attacks, trainers of terrorists, financiers of terrorists, bomb makers, bodyguards for Osama bin Laden, recruiters of terrorists, and facilitators of terrorism. (4) Many of the detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay provided valuable intelligence that gave the United States insight into al Qaeda and its methods, prevented terrorist attacks, and saved lives. (5) Intelligence obtained from detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay was critical to eventually identifying the location of Osama bin Laden. (6) In a February 17, 2011, hearing of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, the Secretary of Defense confirmed that approximately 25 percent of detainees released from the detention facility at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay are confirmed to have reengaged in hostilities or are suspected of having reengaged in hostilities against the United States or our allies. (7) Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an organization that includes former detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay among its leadership and ranks, has claimed responsibility for several of the recent plots and attacks against the United States. (8) Detention according to the law of war is a matter of national security and military necessity and has long been recognized as legitimate under international law. (9) Detaining unprivileged enemy belligerents prevents them from returning to the battlefield to attack United States and allied military personnel and engaging in future terrorist attacks against innocent civilians. (10) The Joint Task Force-Guantanamo provides for the humane, legal, and transparent care and custody of detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, notwithstanding regular assaults on the guard force by some detainees. (11) The International Committee of the Red Cross visits detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay on a quarterly basis. (12) The detention facility at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay benefits from robust oversight by Congress. SEC. 3. REAFFIRMATION OF AUTHORITY TO MAINTAIN UNITED STATES NAVAL STATION, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA, AS A LOCATION FOR THE DETENTION OF UNPRIVILEGED ENEMY BELLIGERENTS HELD BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

Immediate actions to resolve the deficiency are recommended; reservoir restrictions may be necessary until resolution of the problem. (E) Unsatisfactory.--A dam safety deficiency exists for normal loading conditions. Immediate remedial action is required for resolution of the problem. (3) Risk hazard classification.--The risk hazard classification referred to in paragraph (1) is one of the following classifications: (A) High.--Six or more lives would be at risk or extensive property damage could occur if the dam failed. (B) Significant.--Between one and six lives would be at risk or significant property damage could occur if the dam failed. (C) Low.--No lives would be at risk and limited property damage would occur if the dam failed. (f) Limitation on Program Authorization.--Work authorized by this Act shall be for the purpose of dam safety maintenance and structural repair. The Secretary may authorize, upon request of an Indian tribe, up to 20 percent of the cost of repairs to be used to provide additional conservation storage capacity or developing benefits beyond those provided by the original dams and reservoirs.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Pakistani Temporary Protected Status Act of 2010''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The summer of 2010 produced Pakistan's worst flooding in 80 years. (2) The 2010 Pakistani floods began in July 2010 following heavy monsoon rains in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan regions of Pakistan and affected the Indus River basin. Flooding began on July 22, 2010, in the province of Baluchistan. (3) According to the United Nations, 20,000,000 people, one-eighth of the population, and nearly 62,000 square miles, one-fifth of the country, have been significantly affected by destruction of property, livelihood, and infrastructure. (4) The Pakistani Government reports that the floods have affected 82 of Pakistan's 122 districts. As a result, more than 12 million people require humanitarian assistance, with nearly 6 million victims lacking access to food, shelter, and water. (5) The Pakistani Government estimates that approximately 1.9 million houses were either damaged or destroyed and nearly 2,000 people have lost their lives. (6) Over 60,000 troops are involved in Pakistan's flood relief operations. (7) The floods severely devastated Pakistan's infrastructure including roads, bridges, schools, health clinics, electricity, and communications. More than 5,000 miles of roads and railways were washed away, along with some 7,000 schools and more than 400 health facilities. (8) In addition, about 17 million acres of Pakistan's most fertile croplands have been submerged by the floods, in a nation where farming is an economic mainstay. The waters have also killed more than 200,000 head of livestock, and washed away large quantities of stored commodities that feed millions throughout the year. (9) On August 14, 2010, the first documented case of cholera emerged in the town of Mingora. (10) On September 7, 2010, the International Labour Organization reported that more than 5.3 million jobs have been lost due to the floods. (11) Concerns are growing about the enduring toll of the disaster on Pakistan's overall economy, food supply, and political stability. (12) Temporary protected status allows aliens who do not legally qualify as refugees but are nonetheless fleeing or reluctant to return to potentially dangerous situations to temporarily remain in the United States. (13) Granting temporary protected status to nationals of Pakistan is consistent with the interests of the United States and promotes the values and morals that have made the United States strong. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of the Congress that the extraordinary and temporary conditions caused by flooding in Pakistan qualifies Pakistan for designation under subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 244(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(b)(1)), pursuant to which nationals of Pakistan would be eligible for temporary protected status in the United States. SEC. 4. DESIGNATION FOR PURPOSES OF GRANTING TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS. (a) Designation.-- (1) In general.--For purposes of section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a), Pakistan shall be treated as if it had been designated under subsection (b) of such section, subject to the provisions of this section. (2) Period of designation.--The initial period of such designation shall begin on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall remain in effect for 12 months. (b) Aliens Eligible.--In applying section 244 of such Act pursuant to the designation made under this section, subject to section 244(c)(3) of such Act, an alien who is a national of Pakistan is deemed to satisfy the requirements of section 244(c)(1) of such Act only if the alien-- (1) has been continuously physically present in the United States since July 22, 2010; (2) is admissible as an immigrant, except as otherwise provided under section 244(c)(2)(A) of such Act, and is not ineligible for temporary protected status under section 244(c)(2)(B) of such Act; and (3) registers for temporary protected status in a manner that the Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish. (c) Consent To Travel Abroad.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall give the prior consent to travel abroad described in section 244(f)(3) of such Act to an alien who is granted temporary protected status pursuant to the designation made under this section, if the alien establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Homeland Security that emergency and extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the alien require the alien to depart for a brief, temporary trip abroad. An alien returning to the United States in accordance with such an authorization shall be treated the same as any other returning alien provided temporary protected status under section 244 of such Act.\n\nSummary:","completion":" Pakistani Temporary Protected Status Act of 2010 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the extraordinary and temporary conditions caused by flooding in Pakistan qualifies Pakistan for designation under the Immigration and Nationality Act pursuant to which its nationals would be eligible for temporary protected status (TPS) in the United States.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``National Capital Area Interest Arbitration Standards Act of 1995''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that-- (1) affordable public transportation is essential to the economic vitality of the national capital area and is an essential component of regional efforts to improve air quality to meet environmental requirements and to improve the health of both residents of and visitors to the national capital area as well as to preserve the beauty and dignity of the Nation's capital; (2) use of mass transit by both residents of and visitors to the national capital area is substantially affected by the prices charged for such mass transit services, prices that are substantially affected by labor costs, since more than \\2\/3\\ of operating costs are attributable to labor costs; (3) labor costs incurred in providing mass transit in the national capital area have increased at an alarming rate and wages and benefits of operators and mechanics currently are among the highest in the Nation; (4) higher operating costs incurred for public transit in the national capital area cannot be offset by increasing costs to patrons, since this often discourages ridership and thus undermines the public interest in promoting the use of public transit; (5) spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the governmental entities that are responsible for subsidy payments for public transit services since local governments generally, and the District of Columbia government in particular, are operating under severe fiscal constraints; (6) imposition of mandatory standards applicable to arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area will ensure that wage increases are justified and do not exceed the ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund the increase; and (7) Federal legislation is necessary under Article I of section 8 of the United States Constitution to balance the need to moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining industrial peace. (b) Purpose.--It is therefore the purpose of this Act to adopt standards governing arbitration which must be applied by arbitrators resolving disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area in order to lower operating costs for public transportation in the Washington metropolitan area. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. As used in this Act-- (1) the term ``arbitration'' means-- (A) the arbitration of disputes, regarding the terms and conditions of employment, that is required under an interstate compact governing an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area; and (B) does not include the interpretation and application of rights arising from an existing collective bargaining agreement; (2) the term ``arbitrator'' refers to either a single arbitrator, or a board of arbitrators, chosen under applicable procedures; (3) an interstate compact agency's ``funding ability'' is the ability of the interstate compact agency, or of any governmental jurisdiction which provides subsidy payments or budgetary assistance to the interstate compact agency, to obtain the necessary financial resources to pay for wage and benefit increases for employees of the interstate compact agency; (4) the term ``interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area'' means any interstate compact agency which provides public transit services; (5) the term ``interstate compact agency'' means any agency established by an interstate compact to which the District of Columbia is a signatory; and (6) the term ``public welfare'' includes, with respect to arbitration under an interstate compact-- (A) the financial ability of the individual jurisdictions participating in the compact to pay for the costs of providing public transit services; and (B) the average per capita tax burden, during the term of the collective bargaining agreement to which the arbitration relates, of the residents of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and the effect of an arbitration award rendered pursuant to such arbitration on the respective income or property tax rates of the jurisdictions which provide subsidy payments to the interstate compact agency established under the compact. SEC. 4. STANDARDS FOR ARBITRATORS. (a) Factors in Making Arbitrary Award.--An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not make a finding or a decision for inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment without considering the following factors: (1) The existing terms and conditions of employment of the employees in the bargaining unit. (2) All available financial resources of the interstate compact agency. (3) The annual increase or decrease in consumer prices for goods and services as reflected in the most recent consumer price index for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. (4) The wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of the employment of other employees who perform, in other jurisdictions in the Washington, D.C. standard metropolitan statistical area, services similar to those in the bargaining unit. (5) The special nature of the work performed by the employees in the bargaining unit, including any hazards or the relative ease of employment, physical requirements, educational qualifications, job training and skills, shift assignments, and the demands placed upon the employees as compared to other employees of the interstate compact agency. (6) The interests and welfare of the employees in the bargaining unit, including-- (A) the overall compensation presently received by the employees, having regard not only for wage rates but also for wages for time not worked, including vacations, holidays, and other excused absences; (B) all benefits received by the employees, including previous bonuses, insurance, and pensions; and (C) the continuity and stability of employment. (7) The public welfare. (b) Compact Agency's Funding Ability.--An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not, with respect to a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment, provide for salaries and other benefits that exceed the interstate compact agency's funding ability. (c) Requirements for Final Award.--In resolving a dispute submitted to arbitration involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area, the arbitrator shall issue a written award that demonstrates that all the factors set forth in subsections (a) and (b) have been considered and applied. An award may grant an increase in pay rates or benefits (including insurance and pension benefits), or reduce hours of work, only if the arbitrator concludes that any costs to the agency do not adversely affect the public welfare. The arbitrator's conclusion regarding the public welfare must be supported by substantial evidence. SEC. 5. PROCEDURES FOR ENFORCEMENT OF AWARDS. (a) Modifications and Finality of Award.--In the case of an arbitration award to which section 4 applies, the interstate compact agency and the employees in the bargaining unit, through their representative, may agree in writing upon any modifications to the award within 10 days after the award is received by the parties. After the end of that 10-day period, the award, with any such modifications, shall become binding upon the interstate compact agency, the employees in the bargaining unit, and the employees' representative. (b) Implementation.--Each party to an award that becomes binding under subsection (a) shall take all actions necessary to implement the award. (c) Judicial Review.--Within 60 days after an award becomes binding under subsection (a), the interstate compact agency or the exclusive representative of the employees concerned may file a civil action in a court which has jurisdiction over the interstate compact agency for review of the award. The court shall review the award on the record, and shall vacate the award or any part of the award, after notice and a hearing, if-- (1) the award is in violation of applicable law; (2) the arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers; (3) the decision by the arbitrator is arbitrary or capricious; (4) the arbitrator conducted the hearing contrary to the provisions of this Act or other statutes or rules that apply to the arbitration so as to substantially prejudice the rights of a party; (5) there was partiality or misconduct by the arbitrator prejudicing the rights of a party; (6) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or bias on the part of the arbitrator; or (7) the arbitrator did not comply with the provisions of section 4.\n\nSummary:","completion":" National Capital Area Interest Arbitration Standards Act of 1995 - Provides for the adoption of mandatory standards and procedures governing the actions of arbitrators in the arbitration of labor disputes involving transit agencies operating in the Washington, D.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Protect the Homeland from North Korean and Iranian Ballistic Missiles Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) The United States Constitution indicates one of the first purposes of government is to provide for the defense of the American people. (2) North Korea continues to develop the Taepo Dong 2 long- range missile. (3) The United States intelligence community estimated that the Taepo Dong 2, when fully developed, could threaten the entire continental United States with a ballistic missile. (4) North Korea tested the Taepo Dong 2 missile over the Sea of Japan on July 4, 2006, in defiance of warnings from the United States, Japan, South Korea, and the People's Republic of China. (5) North Korea, in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1695 and 1718, launched a long range ballistic missile on April 5, 2009. This test demonstrates that North Korean long range ballistic missiles can now reach South Korea, Japan, and Guam and can travel 2,000 miles over Japan into the Pacific Ocean. (6) North Korea ordered inspectors out of the country and walked away from the 6 party talks on April 14, 2009. (7) North Korea has deployed the Musudan intermediate range ballistic missile which can threaten Okinawa and Guam, 200 No Dong missiles which can reach Japan, and 600 Scud missiles which threaten South Korea. (8) On April 29, 2009, North Korea threatened to conduct a nuclear test and an intercontinental ballistic missile unless the United Nations Security Council apologized for imposing sanctions against North Korea. (9) North Korea, in violation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1718, conducted a nuclear test on May 25, 2009. (10) North Korea's missile launch and nuclear test demonstrate present international diplomatic efforts are not sufficient to deter North Korea from developing, deploying, and launching missiles or developing nuclear technology. (11) North Korea has test-fired six short-range missiles off the country's east coast since the May 25, 2009, nuclear test. (12) Recently North Korea has asserted it is no longer bound by the armistice which ended the Korean War and has threatened war against the United States, South Korea, and Japan. (13) North Korea leads the world in missile proliferation. (14) North Korea is known to share ballistic missile technology with other weapons proliferating nations such as Iran. (15) North Korea aided Syria with its nuclear program. (16) The Director of the Missile Defense Agency said on June 9, 2009, ``The United States has fine-tuned its ability to shoot down long-range missiles that could be launched by North Korea based on a trio of tests mimicking such an attack.''. (17) On February 3, 2009, the Government of Iran successfully launched its first satellite into orbit--an act in direct violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737. (18) General Maples, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, recently said, ``Iran's February 3, 2009, launch of the Safir space launch vehicle shows progress in mastering technology needed to produce ICBMs.''. (19) On April 5, 2009, President Barack Obama said, ``So let me be clear: Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the United States, but to Iran's neighbors and our allies.''. (20) On May 19, 2009, the Government of Iran test-fired a new two-stage, medium-range, solid fuel, surface-to-surface missile, which can reach Europe, Israel, and United States forces deployed in the Persian Gulf Region. SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING NORTH KOREA'S AND IRAN'S LONG- RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILE TECHNOLOGY. Congress-- (1) acknowledges that North Korea's and Iran's long-range ballistic missile technology is improving and could be used to deliver chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons; (2) expresses concern that North Korea's and Iran's long- range ballistic missile technology poses a real threat to the United States homeland; (3) realizes missile delivery technology and warheads could be passed along to state and non-state actors; and (4) supports ballistic missile protection of United States allies and forward deployed forces but believes it should not come at the expense of the protection of the United States homeland. SEC. 4. DEPLOYMENT OF MISSILE DEFENSE INTERCEPTORS IN ALASKA AND CALIFORNIA. The Secretary of Defense shall deploy the following: (1) Not less than 40 ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska. (2) Not less than 4 ground-based interceptors at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. (3) Such number of ground-based interceptors at such other locations as the President determines appropriate. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE SYSTEM.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Global Trade Requires Unmitigated Truth in Health (TRUTH) Act'' . SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) The rise of global trade has created both new commercial opportunities and new health risks. (2) Governments have the right and responsibility to protect their countries from the threat of disease. (3) Trade is responsible for contributing to the rapid spread of disease around the globe and increases the risk of a pandemic outbreak. (4) Those who participate in world trade, therefore, have a responsibility to promptly report and appropriately respond to infectious diseases on a timely basis to minimize the potential for global pandemics. (5) The World Health Organization has created the World Health Organization International Health Regulations to prevent, protect against, and control disease and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and that avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. (6) The failure of countries to be transparent and responsive to the existence or spread of disease in a country that is a member of the World Trade Organization threatens the free flow of goods and services that is a primary objective of the GATT 1994 and other agreements of the World Trade Organization. (7) The experience with the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003 should be a clear warning that the system of public health readiness can be easily compromised by delays in reporting the earliest cases of an outbreak by a country reluctant to publicize a problem with an economic downside, no matter the public health consequences. (8) If a country fails to abide by regulations which are designed to prevent, protect against, and control disease and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease without unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade, it may be necessary to take actions against that country which restrict or otherwise interfere with international traffic or trade in the best interest of public health. SEC. 3. WTO PROPOSAL. (a) Action by United States Trade Representative.--The United States Trade Representative shall-- (1) propose to the World Trade Organization that the rights and obligations of the World Trade Organization should take into account whether countries are undermining the trade system by failing to abide by the rules of other international organizations with regard to public health, specifically the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization; and (2) include in the proposal options for its implementation, such as-- (A) provisions that would give members of the World Trade Organization the right to impose sanctions or other punitive measures on members that have been found to violate the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization; and (B) membership criteria for current and potential members of the World trade Organization that would include the requirement to uphold the trade system by abiding by rules of other international organizations with regard to public health. (b) Report to Congress.--The United States Trade Representative shall report to the Congress, not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and not later than the end of each 90-day period thereafter, on steps the Trade Representative has taken to carry out subsection (a), and the results of those steps. SEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORT ON COUNTRY COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS.

(b) Contents.--Each report under subsection (a) shall include the following information: (1) The extent to which each country complies with and enforces the requirements contained in the International Health Regulations. (2) The extent to which each country uses effective epidemiological principles to detect, reduce, or eliminate the sources from which infection spreads, to improve sanitation in and around ports and airports, to prevent the dissemination of vectors, and, in general, to encourage epidemiological activities on the national level so that there is little risk of outside infection establishing itself in that country. (3) The steps that the Secretary has taken to alter United States programs or policies with respect to any country because of unsatisfactory compliance with the International Health Regulations. (4) For each country in which the report indicates that the country's health administration has failed to notify the World Health Organization within 24 hours of its being informed that the first case of a disease subject to the International Health Regulations, that is neither an imported case nor a transferred case, has occurred in its territory, or, within the subsequent 24 hours, has failed to notify the infected area, the extent to which the United States has taken or will take action to encourage such notifications. (5) The extent to which each country communicates frequent and detailed information to the World Health Organization about the presence of plague, cholera, yellow fever, avian influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and any other disease determined by the Secretary that is present in its country. The report shall describe whether each country communicates to the World Health Organization the number of cases and deaths at least once each week, and the precautions taken to prevent the spread of the disease, in particular the measures which are being applied to prevent the spread of the disease to other territories by vessels, aircraft, trains, road vehicles, other means of transport, and containers leaving the infected area. (6) What steps the government of each country has taken to ensure that ports and airports in its territory have at their disposal an organization and equipment adequate for the application of the measures provided for in the International Health Regulations. (7) What steps the government of each country has taken to make available, at as many of the ports and airports in a territory as practicable, an organized medical and health service with adequate staff, equipment, and premises, in particular facilities for the prompt isolation and care of infected persons, for disinfection, disinsecting, and deratting, for bacteriological investigation, for the collection and examination of rodents for plague infection, for collection of water and food samples and their dispatch to a laboratory for examination, and for other appropriate measures provided for by the International Health Regulations.\n\nSummary:","completion":" Global Trade Requires Unmitigated Truth in Health (TRUTH) Act - Requires the US Trade Representative (USTR) to: (1) propose to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that its rights and obligations should take into account whether countries are undermining the trade system by failing to abide by the rules of other international organizations with regard to public health, specifically the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: (1) Cavernous angioma, also termed ``cerebral cavernous malformations'' or ``CCM'', affects an estimated 1,500,000 people in the United States. (2) Cavernous angioma is a devastating blood vessel disease that is characterized by the presence of vascular lesions that develop and grow within the brain and spinal cord. (3) Detection of cavernous angioma lesions is achieved though costly and specialized medical imaging techniques. (4) Cavernous angioma is a common type of vascular anomaly, but individuals may not be aware that they have the disease until the onset of serious clinical symptoms. (5) Individuals diagnosed with cavernous angioma may experience neurological deficits, seizure, stroke, or sudden death. (6) Due to limited research with respect to cavernous angioma, there is no treatment regimen for the disease other than brain and spinal surgery. (7) Some individuals with cavernous angioma are not candidates for brain surgery, and no treatment option is available for such individuals. (8) There is a shortage of physicians who are familiar with cavernous angioma and affected individuals may find it difficult to receive timely diagnosis and appropriate care. (9) Due to the presence of a specific disease-causing mutation, termed the ``common Hispanic mutation'' that has passed through as many as 17 generations of Americans descended from the original Spanish settlers of the Southwest in the 1590s, New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma in the world. Cavernous angioma affects tens of thousands of individuals in New Mexico. (10) Other States with high rates of cavernous angioma include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. (11) Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, agreed to May 13, 2009, which was adopted unanimously, expresses the sense of the Senate that there is a critical need to increase research, awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous malformations. (12) The National Institutes of Health promotes advances in biomedical research by supporting extramural research at institutes of higher education, in part through extramural centers of excellence. These centers promote research through a multidisciplinary, team-based approach in order to better understand complex biomedical systems and translate basic scientific discoveries into useful clinical applications. (13) To address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma in New Mexico and throughout the United States, there is a need for a Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center in order to provide a model medical system for other such centers, to facilitate medical research to develop a cure for cavernous angioma, and to enhance the medical care of individuals with cavernous angioma nationwide. (14) Given the existing programs and expertise at the University of New Mexico, the first coordinated, centralized Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center should be established at the University of New Mexico. SEC. 3. CAVERNOUS ANGIOMA CARE CENTER. Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 284 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``SEC. 409K.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Although title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, one section of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights' 1997 final policy guidance, entitled ``Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties'' published in the Federal Register on March 13, 1997, 62 Fed. Reg. 12034, included a determination that ``sexual harassment directed at gay or lesbian students that is sufficiently serious to limit or deny a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program constitutes sexual harassment prohibited by title IX under the circumstances described in this guidance.''. This language was unchanged in a 2001 update of the policy guidance entitled ``Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties'' for which a notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on January 19, 2001, 66 Fed. Reg. 5512. (2) That section of the 2001 ``Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties'' went on to state: ``Though beyond the scope of this guidance, gender-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, but not involving conduct of a sexual nature, is also a form of sex discrimination to which a school must respond, if it rises to the level that denies or limits a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the educational program..A school must respond to such harassment in accordance with the standards and procedures described in this guidance.''. (3) There is evidence that brings into question the degree to which the policy guidance on sexual harassment against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students is being implemented. For example, a 7-State study by Human Rights Watch of the abuses suffered by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students at the hands of their peers, published in ``Hatred in the Hallways: Violence and Discrimination Against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Students in U.S. Schools'' found that such students were often the victims of abuses. (4) A 2000 study by the American Association of University Women focused on implementation of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 more generally, and the findings of that study, published in ``A License for Bias: Sex Discrimination, Schools, and Title IX'', included a finding that many schools and universities have not established procedures for handling title IX-based grievances. (5) The 2001 report of the Surgeon General, entitled ``Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior'' notes that ``antihomosexual attitudes are associated with psychological distress for homosexual persons and may have a negative impact on mental health, including a greater incidence of depression and suicide, lower self-acceptance and a greater likelihood of hiding sexual orientation.''. It goes on to report: ``Averaged over two dozen studies, 80 percent of gay men and lesbians had experienced verbal or physical harassment on the basis of their orientation, 45 percent had been threatened with violence, and 17 percent had experienced a physical attack.''. (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for an examination of how secondary schools are implementing the policy guidance of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights related to sexual harassment directed against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students. SEC. 2. STUDY OF HOW EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTING THE POLICY GUIDANCE RELATING TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. (a) In General.--The United States Commission on Civil Rights (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Commission'') shall conduct a study of the 1997 final policy guidance entitled ``Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties'' published in the Federal Register on March 13, 1997, 62 Fed. Reg. 12034, and the application of such policy guidance. (b) Scope.-- (1) Nationwide.--The study shall be conducted nationwide. (2) Elements of study.--The study shall examine, at a minimum, with regard to secondary schools-- (A) the extent to which there exists sexual harassment against gay and lesbian students in secondary schools, using the applicable standards in the policy guidance of the Office for Civil Rights described in subsection (a); (B) the extent to which there exists gender-based harassment that negatively affects the learning environment of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students in secondary schools, applying the definition of such gender-based harassment contained in the 2001 update of the policy guidance entitled ``Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties'' for which a notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on January 19, 2001, 66 Fed. Reg. 5512; (C) the level of awareness by school officials and students of the policy guidance described in subsection (a); and (D) the level of implementation of such policy guidance. (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``secondary school'' has the meaning given the term in section 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801). SEC. 3. REPORTING OF FINDINGS. (a) In General.--Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall transmit to Congress and to the Secretary of Education-- (1) a report of the Commission's findings under section 2; and (2) any policy recommendations developed by the Commission based upon the study carried out under section 2. (b) Dissemination.--The report and recommendations shall be disseminated, in a manner that is easily understandable, to the public by means that include the Internet. SEC. 4. COOPERATION OF FEDERAL AGENCIES. (a) In General.--The head of each Federal department or agency shall cooperate in all respects with the Commission with respect to the study under section 2. (b) Information.--The head of each Federal department or agency shall provide to the Commission, to the extent permitted by law, such data, reports, and documents concerning the subject matter of such study as the Commission may request.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Colville National Forest Adaptive Management of Timber Resources Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Forest vegetation on Federal lands in the intermountain West, including eastern Washington and particularly the Colville National Forest in the State of Washington, is in an extremely overstocked condition due to fire exclusion and nonmanagement, resulting in unhealthy, low-vigor stands that are susceptible to disease, insects, and fire. (2) The value of this forest vegetation far exceeds the cost of managing these stands for a healthy, productive ecosystem, but the current regulatory structure of overlapping directives and planning documents hinders management of this forest vegetation in a manner necessary to achieve, simultaneously, healthy and productive ecosystems and community benefits. (3) The current regulatory structure and overall policy direction further hinder the flexibility of the Forest Service to plan and prepare projects that effectively consider local conditions and opportunities or capture market opportunities. (4) Federal budgetary limitations have reduced the trained and experienced Forest Service workforce below the level necessary to plan for and maintain healthy and productive ecosystems. At the same time the Forest Service is forced to spend a disproportionate amount of its resources on planning, with insufficient resources remaining to implement scientifically acceptable forest management activities. (5) Implementation of adaptive management techniques in selected areas of the Colville National Forest will provide a healthy ecosystem, provide for long-term national fiber needs, generate funds in excess of costs, and stimulate the economies of local, resource-dependent communities. (6) The scientific knowledge gained from projects conducted using the adaptive management techniques required under this Act will benefit similar forest stands throughout the intermountain West. (7) The economic knowledge gained from such projects will benefit management projects in all timber stands. SEC. 3. PURPOSES. The purposes of this Act are the following: (1) To combat the adverse human and environmental consequences of catastrophic wildfire, including immediate-term loss of life, vegetation, soil, water, and nearby land use, and long-term loss of land productivity and continuous resource flow. (2) To use a creditable, science-based, adaptive management approach to manage fire-generated, overstocked, small-diameter, stagnated forest stands to improve forest health, meet current and future environmental needs, and provide wood fiber for processing in dependent communities. (3) To demonstrate the cost-effective use of private contractors to perform substantive planning and plan implementation tasks for the Forest Service. SEC. 4. PREPARATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND EVALUATION OF ADAPTIVE FOREST MANAGEMENT IN COLVILLE NATIONAL FOREST. (a) Adaptive Management Research Plan Required.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall prepare and submit to Congress a research plan, including supporting environmental documents, that provides for the implementation and evaluation of controlled silvicultural treatment in fire-generated, overstocked, small-diameter, stagnated forest stands in designated areas of the Colville National Forest in the State of Washington for the purpose of testing the effect of adaptive management techniques in the treatment of such forest stands. (b) Areas Covered by Plan.--The research plan prepared under subsection (a) shall apply to the following areas of the Colville National Forest: (1) The approximately 110,000 acres of the Colville National Forest identified as economically suited for adaptive management techniques in the Forest Service study of 1989-1994 regarding creating opportunities. (2) Other lands in the Colville National Forest selected by the Secretary as having characteristics similar to the lands identified in paragraph (1). (c) Implementation of Plan.--The Secretary shall implement the research plan prepared under subsection (a) not later than the second full field season beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary may begin an initial demonstration project based on a preliminary draft of the research plan as soon as practicable in an area of approximately 10,000 acres. (d) Use of Private Sector.--Subject to the availability of funds for this purpose under subsection (e), the Secretary may use private contractors, including individuals and groups involved in the preparation of the study referred to in subsection (b)(1), in the preparation and implementation of the research plan required under subsection (a) and in monitoring the effects of the research plan under subsection (i). To the greatest extent practicable, such private contractors shall be selected from communities adversely affected by reductions in the timber sale program of the National Forest System. (e) Funding.-- (1) Establishment of special account.--To fund the preparation and implementation of the research plan required under subsection (a), the Secretary shall establish an account to be known as the ``Ecosystem Adaptive Management Demonstration Account''. (2) Funds for account.--There shall be allocated or transferred to the account the following: (A) A portion of the amount annually allocated to the Colville National Forest pursuant to any other provision of law, to be based on the proportion of the Colville National Forest subject to the research plan. (B) The amounts deposited pursuant to subsection (g)(3). (C) Any amounts borrowed under paragraph (3). (3) Borrowing authority.--To the extent necessary to fund startup costs under the research plan, the Secretary may borrow amounts from salvage sale accounts of the Forest Service or amounts available under the Act of June 9, 1930 (16 U.S.C. 576 et seq; commonly known as the Knutson-Vandenberg Act). The Secretary shall repay amounts borrowed, without interest, using funds deposited in the account under subsection (g)(3). (f) Use of Account.--The Secretary shall use amounts in the special account established under subsection (e) for-- (1) the design and implementation of research projects conducted under the research plan prepared under subsection (a), except that the Secretary shall use funds from other sources to cover any costs related to appeals or litigation concerning those projects; and (2) to the extent amounts remain available in the special account after expenditures under paragraph (1), vegetative management activities, fuels treatment, monitoring, and watershed improvement projects within the areas covered by the research plan. (g) Treatment of Receipts.--Receipts generated from the sale of forest products resulting from silvicultural treatments under the research plan prepared under subsection (a) shall be deposited or utilized as follows: (1) 25 percent shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury of the United States as a miscellaneous receipt, pursuant to the procedures specified in the fifth paragraph under the heading ``FOREST SERVICE'' in the Act of March 4, 1907 (34 Stat. 1270; 16 U.S.C. 499), and related laws. (2) 25 percent shall be provided to the State of Washington pursuant to the procedures specified in the sixth paragraph under the heading ``FOREST SERVICE'' in the Act of May 23, 1908 (35 Stat. 260; 16 U.S.C. 500). (3) 50 percent shall be deposited in the special account established under subsection (e). (h) Schedule of Silvicultural Treatments.--Silvicultural treatments under the research plan prepared under subsection (a) shall be conducted during the 10-year period beginning on the date the research plan is first implemented. The total number of acres treated in each of the first 5 years shall not vary by more than 20 percent from \\1\/10\\ of the total acres covered by the research plan. (i) Monitoring and Reports.--The Secretary shall commence monitoring of the effects of research activities under the research plan prepared under subsection (a) immediately after implementation of the research plan. Monitoring activities shall continue for a period of not less than 15 years. At 5-year intervals during the monitoring period, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report containing the results of the monitoring, findings derived from the research projects under the research plan, and the implications of such findings for management of similar overstocked stands. Each report shall include a detailed accounting of direct costs and returns associated with the implementation of the research plan.\n\nSummary:","completion":" Colville National Forest Adaptive Management of Timber Resources Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct an adaptive forest management research program in Colville National Forest, Washington, which shall include silvicultural treatments.

The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission which will submit findings and recommendations to provide a more effective presentation of capital and operating expenses of the United States Government. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The Federal Government does not take a comprehensive look at capital investment programs across agency and program lines to see how they fit into a national strategy for maintaining and improving the Nation's public facilities. (2) Both the executive branch and the Congress tend to set priorities for physical capital investment program-by-program. There is no consistent basis for setting priorities among projects and programs, and there is no framework in which to identify those having similar objectives and those that are at cross-purposes. (3) This program- and project-orientation makes planning for public facilities vulnerable to short-term factors, thus impairing the stability and predictability needed for an efficient capital investment program. (4) A separate capital budget would establish a useful planning process because it would focus on long-term projects, costs, and benefits. SEC. 4. COMMISSION ON THE PRESENTATION OF THE BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Genomic Science and Technology Innovation Act of 2002''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) Genomic science promises a revolution in the development of new and effective genomic technologies and other innovations, and it is in the national interest to speed the development and deployment of these new technologies through policies that promote innovation in the field of genomic science and technology. (2) While Federal innovation policies can help stimulate innovation by attracting capital investment to the development of commercial products, such policies can also inhibit basic research and hinder sharing of information that is the basis of scientific progress, thereby slowing the innovation process. (3) Intellectual property policies for genomic science and technology products are being implemented without an adequate understanding and consideration of the net impact of such policies on the innovation process. (4) Decisions about intellectual property policy being made now are likely to have significant impacts on basic research and the development of genomic technology for decades to come. (5) The Office of Science and Technology Policy is uniquely positioned to lead the development of a coordinated, interagency policy to promote innovation in genomic science and technology. A definitive study coordinated by the Office of Science and Technology Policy that identifies the impacts of Federal innovation policy on the innovation pipeline for genomic technology and includes recommendations for policies, including any statutory changes needed to optimize the genomic technology innovation pipeline, would contribute significantly to the development of the policy. SEC. 3. STUDY. (a) Requirement.--The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall conduct, or may contract with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct, a study that assesses the impact of Federal policies, including intellectual property policies, on the innovation process for genomic technologies.

(c) Advisory Committee.--In conducting the study, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall consult with an advisory committee, organized as a subcommittee of the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, that shall include balanced membership from research universities and other nonprofit research institutions, industry, economists, legal experts, bioethicists, clinicians and clinical scientists, genetic practitioners, and advocacy groups. (d) Contents.--The study shall-- (1) identify and quantify, to extent possible, the actual and reasonably expected effects of innovation policy on genomic science and technology innovation; (2) explicitly consider various alternative levels of intellectual property protection genomic materials may receive and the likely impact of the various levels of protection on each element of the innovation pipeline, including-- (A) fundamental genomic research carried out at universities and other nonprofit research institutions; (B) commercial genomic research at universities, nonprofit research institutions, and for-profit institutions, including the expected effects on intracompany investment and external private capital; (C) development of commercial genomic technologies, including the expected effects on investment capital; and (D) access to genomic technologies and processes; and (3) include an assessment of the net impact of Federal innovation policies on innovation for genomic technologies, including an assessment of-- (A) researchers' access to genomic materials; (B) the rate of innovation; (C) the quality of innovation; (D) the cost of new genomic technologies brought to market; (E) the impact of restricted access to genomic diagnostics on evaluation, improvement, and clinical utilization; (F) the cost and availability of innovative technology; (G) whether Federal innovation policies create barriers to research through denial of use of a research tool, increased costs of licensing, legal and litigation costs, transaction costs, or the perception of increased legal liability, or hinder the access of researchers to genomic materials and to databases of genomic sequence information; (H) whether Federal innovation policies affect the choice of area of research conducted by researchers or institutions or provide positive benefits to such research, including additional funding from private sector partners; and (I) the range of incentives providing motivation for genetics research and technology development other than intellectual property protection. SEC. 4. REPORT. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall, within 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, transmit a report to Congress that-- (1) contains the findings of the study conducted under section 3; and (2) makes recommendations for policies, including legislative changes, needed to optimize the genomic technology innovation pipeline. SEC. 5. COORDINATED POLICY. After the report is transmitted to Congress under section 4, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall incorporate the policy recommendations into a coordinated interagency policy to promote innovation in genomic science and technology, including the sound use of intellectual property policy. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act-- (1) the term ``genomic materials'' means any material containing a human or human pathogen polynucleotide sequence other than genetic probes and markers and transgenic organisms; (2) the term ``genomic technology'' means any genetic diagnostic methods or kits, tools, probes, or markers, and any pharmaceutical or therapy that uses or incorporates genomic materials; and (3) the term ``innovation policy'' includes intellectual property protection and policies.\n\nSummary:","completion":" Genomic Science and Technology Innovation Act of 2002 - Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to conduct, or contract with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct, a study that assesses the impact of Federal policies, including intellectual property policies, on the innovation process for genomic technologies.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Manufacturing Extension Partnership services are available in all 50 States and at 392 locations. (2) The Manufacturing Extension Partnership delivers critical services to small and midsized manufacturers, providing access to public and private resources that enhance growth, improve productivity, and expand capacity. (3) The Manufacturing Extension Partnership helps manufacturers position themselves as strong long-term competitors in domestic and international markets. (4) Of the 7 million jobs lost in the recession as of February 2009, over 2 million were from the manufacturing sector, and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership reported creating or retaining over 57,000 manufacturing jobs in the most recent surveyed year. (5) The Manufacturing Extension Partnership has delivered $1.44 billion in cost savings annually and $10.5 billion in increased or retained sales in a single year. (6) Every dollar contributed by the Federal Government to the Manufacturing Extension Partnership is matched 2-to-1 by State and local governments and participating manufacturers. (7) The recession has strained many State budgets, and 23 State Manufacturing Extension Partnership Centers reported a decrease or elimination of State funding in 2009. (8) When a State decreases or eliminates funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, the cost-share burden is shifted to small manufacturers who are unlikely to be able to afford increased contributions during an economic downturn, and the availability of Manufacturing Extension Partnership services is jeopardized. (9) A reduction in the matching requirement for participants in the Manufacturing Extension Partnership will greatly alleviate the burden on State budgets and small manufacturers and preserve the Manufacturing Extension Partnership's ability to provide critical services to small manufacturers and create much-needed jobs in the manufacturing sector.

Congress finds that-- (1) the generic programs to promote and provide research and information for an agricultural commodity (commonly known as ``checkoff programs'') are intended to increase demand for all of that agricultural commodity and benefit all assessed producers of that agricultural commodity; (2) although the laws establishing checkoff programs broadly prohibit the use of funds in any manner for the purpose of influencing legislation or government action, checkoff programs have repeatedly been shown to use funds to influence policy directly or by partnering with organizations that lobby; (3) the unlawful use of checkoff programs funds benefits some agricultural producers while harming many others; (4) to more effectively prevent Boards from using funds for unlawful purposes, strict separation of engagement between the Boards and policy entities is necessary; (5) conflicts of interest in the checkoff programs allow special interests to use checkoff program funds for the benefit of some assessed agricultural producers at the expense of many others; (6) prohibiting conflicts of interest in checkoff programs is necessary to ensure the proper and lawful operation of the checkoff programs; (7) checkoff programs are designed to promote agricultural commodities, not to damage other types of agricultural commodities through anticompetitive conduct or otherwise; (8) prohibiting anticompetitive and similar conduct is necessary to ensure proper and lawful operation of checkoff programs; (9) lack of transparency in checkoff programs enables abuses to occur and conceals abuses from being discovered; and (10) requiring transparency in the expenditure of checkoff program funds is necessary to prevent and uncover abuses in checkoff programs.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Parental Right to Decide Protection Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) HPV, the human papillomavirus, is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. HPV types 16 and 18 cause about 70 percent of cervical cancers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 6,200,000 Americans become infected with HPV each year and that over half of all sexually active men and women become infected at some time in their lives. On average, there are 9,710 new cases of cervical cancer and 3,700 deaths attributed to it in the United States each year. (2) Early detection is the key to diagnosing and curing cervical cancer, and therefore the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that all women get regular Pap tests. The Pap test looks for cell changes caused by HPV, so the cervix can be treated before the cells turn into cancer. The FDA also states the Pap test can also find cancer in its early stages so it can be treated before it becomes too serious, and reaches the conclusion that it is rare to die from cervical cancer if the disease is caught early. (3) On June 8, 2006, the FDA approved Gardasil, the first vaccine developed to prevent cervical cancer, precancerous genital lesions, and genital warts due to human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18. Gardasil is a recombinant vaccine, it does not contain a live virus, and it is given as three injections over a six-month period. The vaccine is approved for use in females 9-26 years of age. However, the FDA also states that since the vaccine is new, more studies need to be done to determine how long women will be protected from HPV. For example, the FDA does not know if a booster is needed after a couple of years to ensure continuity of protection. (4) As detailed by the FDA, four studies were conducted in 21,000 women, one in the United States and three multinational, to show how well Gardasil worked in women between the ages of 16 and 26. The study period was not long enough for cervical cancer to develop; however, preventing cervical precancerous lesions is believed highly likely to result in the prevention of cervical cancer. (5) In January 2007 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, issued changes to the previous childhood and adolescent immunization schedule. The ACIP recommends the new human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) to be administered in a 3- dose schedule with the second and third doses administered 2 and 6 months after the first dose. Routine vaccination with HPV is recommended for females aged 11-12 years, the vaccination series can be started in females as young as age 9 years, and a catch up vaccination is recommended for females aged 13-26 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the full vaccine series. (6) In July 2008 Judicial Watch, a Washington-based public interest group, reported that there have been close to 9,000 health complaints as a result of Gardasil. These complaints have surfaced because Gardasil recipients have experienced everything from massive wart outbreaks to paralysis, and even death in 18 cases. (7) States historically have maintained the practice of applying immunization recommendations to their school admittance policies so as to protect schoolchildren from outbreaks of contagious disease. The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons states that there is no public health purpose for mandating HPV vaccine for schoolchildren. HPV is a sexually transmitted disease. (8) With a number of states entertaining legislation which takes the unprecedented step in requiring young girls to obtain a vaccine for a disease that is not spread by casual contact in order to attend school, many organizations and associations have come out against mandatory HPV vaccine programs. (9) The American College of Pediatricians and the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons are opposed to any legislation which would require HPV vaccination for school attendance. They have stated that excluding children from school for refusal to be vaccinated for a disease spread only by intercourse is a serious, precedent-setting action that trespasses on the right of parents to make medical decisions for their children as well as on the rights of the children to attend school. (10) Federal funds should not be used to implement a mandatory vaccine program for a disease that does not threaten the public health of schoolchildren in the course of casual, daily interaction between classmates and inserts the government into the lives of children, parents, and physicians. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION AGAINST FUNDING FOR MANDATORY HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) VACCINATION PROGRAMS. No Federal funds or other assistance may be made available to any State or political subdivision of a State to establish or implement any requirement that individuals receive vaccination for human papillomavirus (HPV).\n\nSummary:","completion":" Parental Right to Decide Protection Act - Prohibits federal funds or other assistance from being made available to any state or political subdivision to establish or implement any requirement that individuals receive vaccination for human papillomavirus (HPV).

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Accounting for Methane in Production through Loophole Elimination with Oil and Gas Royalties'' or the ``AMPLE Oil and Gas Royalties Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) Some of the mineral resources owned by the Federal Government on behalf of United States taxpayers are being developed inefficiently, costing taxpayers millions of dollars in lost royalties, especially with respect to vented, flared, and leaked natural gas. The Government Accountability Office estimates that approximately 40 percent of natural gas could be economically captured from Federal onshore leases, which would increase Federal royalty payments by approximately $23,000,000 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to up to 16.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to annual emissions from 3.1 million cars. (2) Significant emissions of natural gas are associated with oil and gas production and transportation, including oil and gas produced on Federal lands. According to a University of Maryland study, these emissions can negatively impact air quality hundreds of miles away. (3) Methane has a much greater impact on climate change than carbon dioxide, and the methane emissions from oil and gas production can greatly diminish the benefit of using natural gas to help reduce the carbon intensity of the United States fuel mix. (4) Available control technologies exist to economically capture a considerable amount of natural gas and resulting in taxpayers being delivered the royalties they deserve. (5) Requiring royalty payments on natural gas that is currently flared, vented, unavoidably lost, and used for beneficial purposes will lead to more efficient use of Federal resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase royalty payments to the Federal Government. SEC. 3. VOLUME ALLOCATION OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION. (a) In General.--Section 111(k) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (30 U.S.C. 1721(k)) is amended to read as follows: ``(k) Volume Allocation of Oil and Gas Production.-- ``(1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided by this subsection-- ``(A) a lessee or its designee of a lease in a unit or communitization agreement that contains only Federal leases with the same royalty rate and funds distribution shall report and pay royalties on oil and gas production for each production month based on the actual volume of oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir by or on behalf of that lessee, including all oil and gas not sold by or on behalf of that lessee; ``(B) a lessee or its designee of a lease in any other unit or communitization agreement shall report and pay royalties on oil and gas production for each production month based on the volume of oil and gas produced from such agreement and allocated to the lease in accordance with the terms of the agreement; and ``(C) a lessee or its designee of a lease that is not contained in a unit or communitization agreement shall report and pay royalties on oil and gas production for each production month based on the actual volume of oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir by or on behalf of that lessee, including all oil and gas not sold by or on behalf of that lessee. ``(2) Definition.--In this subsection the term `oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir' means any oil and gas that is produced, sold, vented, flared, used for beneficial purposes, leaked, or otherwise emitted during production.''.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; AND PURPOSES. (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Measures to Encourage Results in Teaching Act of 1998''. (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) All students deserve to be taught by well-educated, competent, and qualified teachers. (2) More than ever before, education has and will continue to become the ticket not only to economic success but to basic survival. Students will not succeed in meeting the demands of a knowledge-based, 21st century society and economy if the students do not encounter more challenging work in school. For future generations to have the opportunities to achieve success the future generations will need to have an education and a teacher workforce second to none. (3) No other intervention can make the difference that a knowledgeable, skillful teacher can make in the learning process. At the same time, nothing can fully compensate for weak teaching that, despite good intentions, can result from a teacher's lack of opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skill needed to help students master the curriculum. (4) The Federal Government established the Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program in 1985 to ensure that teachers and other educational staff have access to sustained and high-quality professional development. This ongoing development must include the ability to demonstrate and judge the performance of teachers and other instructional staff. (5) States should evaluate their teachers on the basis of demonstrated ability, including tests of subject matter knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill. States should develop a test for their teachers and other instructional staff with respect to the subjects taught by the teachers and staff, and should administer the test every 3 to 5 years. (6) Evaluating and rewarding teachers with a compensation system that supports teachers who become increasingly expert in a subject area, are proficient in meeting the needs of students and schools, and demonstrate high levels of performance measured against professional teaching standards, will encourage teachers to continue to learn needed skills and broaden teachers' expertise, thereby enhancing education for all students. (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows: (1) To provide incentives for States to establish and administer periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs for elementary school and secondary school teachers. (2) To encourage States to establish merit pay programs that have a significant impact on teacher salary scales. (3) To encourage programs that recognize and reward the best teachers, and encourage those teachers that need to do better. SEC. 2. STATE INCENTIVES FOR TEACHER TESTING AND MERIT PAY.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``FHA Multifamily Housing Emergency Disposition Act of 1993''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that-- (1) the Department of Housing and Urban Development has a large and growing inventory of multifamily housing projects owned by the Department and multifamily housing projects subject to mortgages in foreclosure that are held by the Department; (2) the total number of such housing projects in the inventory of the Department at the beginning of fiscal year 1993 was 444 and is likely to increase to 742 by the end of fiscal year 1998; (3) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has estimated that the Department will lose as much as $11,900,000,000 as a result of mortgage foreclosures on multifamily housing projects insured by the Department, which is equivalent to 25 percent of the value of all mortgages insured under the General Insurance Fund; (4) the Department is not prepared to manage an inventory of multifamily housing projects as large as the inventory expected by the end of fiscal year 1993, resulting in increased holding and disposition costs for such projects; and (5) existing laws would require the attachment of $7,000,000,000 of rental assistance in the form of 15-year contracts under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to eliminate the backlog of multifamily housing projects in the inventory of the Department. (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act, therefore, is-- (1) to declare that an emergency exists with respect to the disposition of multifamily housing projects in the inventory of the Department; (2) to provide for flexibility in disposing of such projects by removing some of the statutory requirements that impede the sale of such projects; (3) to encourage assistance for residents of such projects through means other than rental assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937; and (4) to maintain, to the maximum extent possible, the low- income character of such projects while disposing of such projects in an economical and expeditious manner. SEC. 3. EMERGENCY PROVISIONS. (a) Authority.--During the period in which the property disposition emergency under this Act is in effect pursuant to section 4, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may dispose of any multifamily housing project in accordance with the provisions this Act.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Law Enforcement Abuse Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) American law enforcement has a fundamental duty to provide compassion, aid, and protection and safety to the people it serves. (2) A primary function of law enforcement is to preserve life, regardless of the race, ethnicity, religion, social or economic standing, sexual preference, or country of origin of the individuals involved. (3) Over many years, thousands of cases of State and local law enforcement agency violations of suspects, detainees, and prisoners went inadequately addressed across the United States, especially in African-American communities and other communities of color or poverty. (4) In recent years, procedures, training, and public oversight have failed to significantly curb or eliminate abuses and murders of innocent suspects and citizens at the hands of officers of the law, to fully investigate claims of excessive use of force, or to adequately reprimand, punish, or remove such offenders or their superiors. (5) A special prosecutor in Chicago has been investigating a police abuse ring that operated over three decades with impunity, responsible for torturing over 200 African-American males in their custody at the Area 2 and Area 3 police headquarters. (6) Since the 1997 New York Police Department torture of Abner Louima, and the fatal shooting of Amadou Bailo Diallo in 1999, public and media attention concerning abuse of power and the unjustified and improper use of force by law enforcement in communities of color has continuously increased, as have the number of outraged community responses and the demands for external oversight of police practices. (7) More recently, police in Chicago on November 25, 2006, police officers in New York City shot 50 times and killed an unarmed man, Sean Bell. The next day, a community rally protested the police action and called for the removal of Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. (8) Fatal shootings and abuse of suspects and prisoners have come to light again recently in other cities, including Atlanta, Georgia, and DeKalb County, Georgia. (9) Every major State and local city law enforcement agency receives and depends on some level of Federal funding, training, grants, or assistance, paid for primarily from the tax revenues of the citizens being abused. (10) The common and continuing unaccountable behavior and silence of members of law enforcement agencies regarding these abuses are a disgrace to the efforts of law enforcement agencies throughout the United States and should not be tolerated. (11) The lack of transparency, oversight, community involvement, independent review and investigation, and consequences to the law enforcement violators makes continuing abuse more likely, and must be reversed by denying Federal funding to any law enforcement agency that fails to establish a minimum of professional training and procedures of engagement; that tolerates abuses or fatal use of excessive force; that fails to operate under rules of transparency and community oversight, investigation, and review; that fails to discipline, remove, or otherwise hold accountable any perpetrators acting under the color of law enforcement; or that refuses to fairly hear each case or allegation of possible abuse or excessive use of force by law enforcement officers, reviewed by an established and independent forum. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of Congress that the dishonorable actions referred to in section 2 should be independently investigated, recorded, and condemned. SEC. 4. INELIGIBILITY FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. (a) In General.--During the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, or until transparency and accountability are fully restored, law enforcement agencies that do not have established procedures for independent oversight and review, or do not hold violations by police of excessive use of force, torture, or manslaughter accountable, shall be ineligible to participate in any Federal program, whether by funding, assistance, contract, grant, personnel support, or otherwise. (b) Licenses.--During the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, any Federal license issued to any such law enforcement agencies shall be suspended, or until transparency and accountability are fully restored. (c) Equipment.--Law enforcement agencies identified as carrying out abuses or wrongful deaths, without consequence or open public review or allegations, shall immediately return all federally-owned equipment in the possession or use of such law enforcement agencies to the appropriate Federal agency. SEC. 5. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DEFINED. In this Act, the term ``law enforcement agencies'' means the following entities in any State or locality within the control and jurisdiction of the United States receiving Federal funds for training, equipment, or other support.\n\nSummary:","completion":" Law Enforcement Abuse Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006 - Expresses the sense of Congress that incidences of law enforcement abuse of citizens should be independently investigated, recorded, and condemned.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that: (1) By Interstate Compact (Chapter 170 of the Laws of 1937 of the State of New York; Chapter 148 of the Laws of 1937 of the State of New Jersey) and by Resolution of the 75th Congress (H.J. Resolution 445), the Palisades Interstate Park Commission was formed in 1937. (2) The Palisades Interstate Park Commission is the only interstate park management agency in the United States and is responsible for the management of 23 parks and historic sites in New York and New Jersey, consisting of 82,000 acres. More than 8,000,000 national and international visitors per year seek outdoor recreational opportunities in the Palisades Park System. The management of these sites is consistent with standards maintained by the National Park Service. (3) Sterling Forest is a biologically diverse 17,500 acre corporate-owned open space property on the New York\/New Jersey border. The property is a highly significant watershed area for northern New Jersey, and an important outdoor recreational asset in the Northeastern United States. Clean drinking water flows from the property into a reservoir system which serves 25 percent of the population of the State of New Jersey. Twenty- seven rare and endangered wildlife species have been identified at Sterling Forest by The Nature Conservancy. The land supports a mixed hardwood forest, wetlands, lakes, glaciated valleys and ridge lines, and is strategically located on a north-south wildlife migratory route. (4) The Appalachian Trail, administered by the National Park Service, passes through Sterling Forest. Sterling Forest shares a common boundary with the 51,680 acre Harriman\/Bear Mountain State Parks in which the first segment of the Appalachian Trail was constructed in 1923. If protected, Sterling Forest would greatly enhance the Appalachian Trail and would become the largest park created in the Northeastern United States since World War II. (5) Sterling Forest is located in the most densely populated metropolitan region in the United States, and is a very critical open space buffer for a large urban population. A 14 percent growth rate is projected for the region in the next 20 years. (6) Lands held and managed by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission in the State of New York traditionally remain on the tax rolls. Taxes are paid by the State. (7) Stewardship and management costs for lands in the Palisades Park System traditionally are paid by the States of New York and New Jersey. (8) The Palisades Interstate Park Commission is committed to a willing seller--willing buyer transaction with the corporate owners of Sterling Forest. Use of eminent domain authority is not anticipated, nor would it be acceptable to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. (9) In establishing the Federal Agencies Program for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Congress specified the need to address the increasing demand for the creation of recreation areas of national significance easily accessible to large centers of the population, and to provide a partial basis for financing the extension of Federal recreational facilities in the East and Midwest. (10) Given the nationally significant watershed, outdoor recreational, and wildlife attributes of Sterling Forest, the demand for park open space in the Northeastern United States, the lack of open space in the densely populated New York-New Jersey-Connecticut Tri-State Region, and the presence of a willing seller and a federally chartered interstate park management agency, there is clear Federal interest in acquiring land in Sterling Forest for permanent protection of watershed, recreational, and wild flora and fauna open space. SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION. (a) Funding.--In order to enhance protection of watershed, outdoor recreational, wildlife habitat, and Appalachian Trail values in the Sterling Forest area of the New York\/New Jersey Highlands Region, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior for transfer to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Commission'') for fiscal year 1995 not more than $35,000,000 to be used by the Commission for purposes of acquiring an undeveloped, open space tract of land presently owned by the Sterling Forest Corporation. Such sums shall remain available for expenditure through fiscal year 1999. (b) Property Taxes.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the United States Government, or relieve the Commission and the State of New York of any obligation otherwise imposed under New York State law, to pay property taxes or provide for the costs of stewardship and management of any lands located in the State of New York which may be acquired through this authorization. (c) Management.--The Commission shall hold and manage all property acquired with funds made available under this Act for the purposes referred to in subsection (a).\n\nSummary:","completion":" Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of the Interior to be transferred to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission to be used to acquire an undeveloped, open space tract of land presently owned by the Sterling Forest Corporation to protect the watershed, outdoor recreational, wildlife habitat, and Appalachian Trail values in the Sterling Forest area of the New YorkNew Jersey Highlands Region.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Video Choice Act of 2005''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Cable rates continue to rise substantially faster than the overall rate of inflation. (2) Wire-based competition in video services is limited to very few markets. According to the Federal Communications Commission, only 2 percent of all cable subscribers have the opportunity to choose between 2 or more wire-based video service providers. (3) It is only through wire-based video competition that price competition exists. The Government Accountability Office has confirmed that where wire-based competition exists, cable rates are 15 percent lower than in markets without competition. (4) It is in the public interest to further wire-based competition in the video services market in order to provide greater consumer choice and lower prices for video services. (5) To spur competition in the communications industry, Congress has decreased the regulatory burden on new entrants, thereby increasing entry into the market and creating competition. (6) The United States continues to fall behind in broadband deployment rates. According to a recent study by the International Telecommunications Union, the United States is now ranked 16th in the world in broadband deployment. (7) The deployment of advanced high capacity networks would greatly spur economic development in rural America. (8) The deployment of advanced networks that can offer substantially higher capacity are critical to the long-term competitiveness of the United States. SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO COMMUNICATIONS ACT.

(3) Goods, services, and promotional activities are often offered by public and private institutions to veterans who demonstrate proof of service in the military, but it is impractical for a veteran to always carry Department of Defense form DD-214 discharge papers to demonstrate such proof. (4) A general purpose veteran identification card made available to veterans would be useful to demonstrate the status of the veterans without having to carry and use official Department of Defense form DD-214 discharge papers.

(5) Dr. Borlaug's accomplishments in terms of bringing radical change to world agriculture and uplifting humanity are without parallel. (6) In the immediate aftermath of World War II, Dr. Borlaug spent 20 years working in the poorest areas of rural Mexico. It was there that Dr. Borlaug made his breakthrough achievement in developing a strain of wheat that could exponentially increase yields while actively resisting disease. (7) With the active support of the governments involved, Dr. Borlaug's ``green revolution'' uplifted hundreds of thousands of the rural poor in Mexico and saved hundreds of millions from famine and outright starvation in India and Pakistan. (8) Dr. Borlaug's approach to wheat production next spread throughout the Middle East. Soon thereafter his approach was adapted to rice growing, increasing the number of lives Dr. Borlaug has saved to more than a billion people. (9) In 1970, Dr. Borlaug received the Nobel Prize, the only person working in agriculture to ever be so honored. Since then he has received numerous honors and awards including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Public Service Medal, the National Academy of Sciences' highest honor, and the Rotary International Award for World Understanding and Peace. (10) At age 91, Dr. Borlaug continues to work to alleviate poverty and malnutrition. He currently serves as president of Sasakawa Global 2000 Africa Project, which seeks to extend the benefits of agricultural development to the 800,000,000 people still mired in poverty and malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. (11) Dr. Borlaug continues to serve as Chairman of the Council of Advisors of the World Food Prize, an organization he created in 1986 to be the ``Nobel Prize for Food and Agriculture'' and which presents a $250,000 prize each October at a Ceremony in Des Moines, Iowa, to the Laureate who has made an exceptional achievement similar to Dr. Borlaug's breakthrough 40 years ago. In the almost 20 years of its existence, the World Food Prize has honored Laureates from Bangladesh, India, China, Mexico, Denmark, Sierra Leone, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. (12) Dr. Borlaug has saved more lives than any other person who has ever lived, and likely has saved more lives in the Islamic world than any other human being in history. (13) Due to a lifetime of work that has led to the saving and preservation of an untold amount of lives, Dr. Norman E. Borlaug is deserving of America's highest civilian award: the congressional gold medal. SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Local Community Radio Act of 2007''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 led to increased ownership consolidation in the radio industry. (2) At a hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, on June 4, 2003, all 5 members of the Federal Communications Commission testified that there has been, in at least some local radio markets, too much consolidation. (3) A commitment to localism--local operations, local research, local management, locally-originated programming, local artists, and local news and events--would bolster radio listening. (4) Local communities have sought to launch radio stations to meet their local needs. However, due to the scarce amount of spectrum available and the high cost of buying and running a large station, many local communities are unable to establish a radio station. (5) In 2003, the average cost to acquire a commercial radio station was more than $2,500,000. (6) In January, 2000, the Federal Communications Commission authorized a new, affordable community radio service called ``low-power FM'' or ``LPFM'' to ``enhance locally focused community-oriented radio broadcasting''. (7) Through the creation of LPFM, the Commission sought to ``create opportunities for new voices on the air waves and to allow local groups, including schools, churches, and other community-based organizations, to provide programming responsive to local community needs and interests''. (8) The Commission made clear that the creation of LPFM would not compromise the integrity of the FM radio band by stating, ``We are committed to creating a low-power FM radio service only if it does not cause unacceptable interference to existing radio service.''. (9) Currently, FM translator stations can operate on the second- and third-adjacent channels to full power radio stations, up to an effective radiated power of 250 watts, pursuant to part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, using the very same transmitters that LPFM stations will use. The Commission based its LPFM rules on the actual performance of these translators that already operate without undue interference to FM stations. The actual interference record of these translators is far more useful than any results that further testing could yield. (10) Small rural broadcasters were particularly concerned about a lengthy and costly interference complaint process. Therefore, in September, 2000, the Commission created a simple process to address interference complaints regarding LPFM stations on an expedited basis. (11) In December, 2000, Congress delayed the full implementation of LPFM until an independent engineering study was completed and reviewed. This delay was due to some broadcasters' concerns that LPFM service would cause interference in the FM band. (12) The delay prevented millions of Americans from having a locally operated, community based radio station in their neighborhood. (13) Over 500 LPFM stations were allowed to proceed despite the congressional action. These stations are currently on the air and are run by local government agencies, groups promoting arts and education to immigrant and indigenous peoples, artists, schools, religious organizations, environmental groups, organizations promoting literacy, and many other civically-oriented organizations. (14) After 2 years and the expenditure of $2,193,343 in taxpayer dollars to conduct this study, the broadcasters' concerns were demonstrated to be unsubstantiated. (15) Minorities represent almost a third of our population. However, according to the Federal Communication Commission's most recent Form 323 data on the race and gender of full power, commercial broadcast licensees, minorities own only 7 percent of all local television and radio stations. Women represent more than half of the population, but own only 6 percent of all local television and radio stations. LPFM stations, while not a solution to the overall inequalities in minority and female broadcast ownership, provide an additional opportunity for underrepresented communities to operate a station and provide local communities with a greater diversity of viewpoints and culture. (16) LPFM stations have proven to be a vital source of information during local or national emergencies. Out of the few stations that were able to stay online during Katrina, several were LPFM stations. In Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, LPFM station WQRZ remained on the air during Hurricane Katrina and served as the Emergency Operations Center for Hancock County. Additionally, after Hurricane Katrina when thousands of evacuees temporarily housed at the Houston Astrodome were unable to hear information about the availability of food and ice, the location of FEMA representatives, and the whereabouts of missing loved ones over the loud speakers, volunteers handed out thousands of transistor radios and established a LPFM station outside the Astrodome to broadcast such information. SEC. 3. REPEAL OF PRIOR LAW. Section 632 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 (Public Law 106-553; 114 Stat. 2762A-111), is repealed. SEC. 4. MINIMUM DISTANCE SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS. The Federal Communications Commission shall modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between-- (1) low-power FM stations; and (2) full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations. SEC. 5. PROTECTION OF RADIO READING SERVICES. The Federal Communications Commission shall retain its rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power non-commercial FM stations that broadcast radio reading services via a subcarrier frequency from potential low-power FM station interference. SEC. 6. ENSURING AVAILABILITY OF SPECTRUM FOR LPFM STATIONS. The Federal Communications Commission when licensing FM translator stations shall ensure-- (1) that licenses are available to both FM translator stations and low-power FM stations; and (2) that such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community. SEC. 7. PROHIBITIONS ON CERTAIN APPLICANTS. The Federal Communications Commission shall modify the rules authorizing the operation of low-power FM radio stations, as proposed in MM Docket No. 99-25, to prohibit any applicant from obtaining a low- power FM license if the applicant has engaged in any manner in the unlicensed operation of any station in violation of section 301 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301). SEC. 8. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION RULES. The Federal Communications Commission shall retain its rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power FM stations that are licensed in significantly populated States with more than 3,000,000 housing units and a population density greater than 1,000 people per square mile land area. SEC. 9. FCC STUDY ON IMPACT OF LPFM ON FULL-POWER COMMERCIAL FM STATIONS. The Federal Communications Commission shall conduct an economic study on the impact that low-power FM stations will have on full-power commercial FM stations.\n\nSummary:","completion":" Local Community Radio Act of 2007 - Repeals provisions in the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, that required the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: (1) modify rules authorizing the operation of low-power FM radio stations to prescribe minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels. (2) prohibit applicants who have engaged in the unlicensed operation of any station from obtaining a low-power FM license. And (3) conduct a program to test whether low-power FM radio stations will result in harmful interference to existing FM radio stations if minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels are not required. Requires the FCC to: (1) modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between specified stations. And (2) retain rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power noncommercial FM stations that broadcast radio reading services via a subcarrier frequency from potential low-power FM station interference.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Tobacco to 21 Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Tobacco use caused 20,800,000 premature deaths in the United States in the 50 years since the Surgeon General's first report on smoking in 1964. (2) The 1964 Surgeon General's report linked cigarette smoking to cancer, and since then, other tobacco products, including cigars, cigarillos, roll-your-own products, and smokeless tobacco have been causally linked to cancer. (3) While substantial gains have been made since 1964, tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, responsible for approximately 500,000 premature deaths each year. (4) Tobacco use costs the United States approximately $170,000,000,000 in direct medical costs and $156,000,000,000 in lost productivity every year. (5) More than 42,000,000 people in the United States still smoke, and the tobacco industry continues to challenge tobacco control victories in court, manipulate products to evade existing regulations, introduce new and dangerous tobacco products, and spend billions on marketing to deceive the public and addict more children. (6) An estimated 5,600,000 youth aged 17 and under are projected to die prematurely from a tobacco-related illness if prevalence rates do not change. (7) Use of tobacco products in any form is not safe, especially during adolescence, as such use can lead to nicotine dependence and subsequent tobacco-related diseases and death. (8) Adolescents are especially vulnerable to the effects of nicotine and nicotine addiction and appear to show signs of nicotine addiction at lower levels of exposure compared to adults. (9) Nicotine exposure during adolescence may have long lasting adverse consequences on brain development. (10) The likelihood of developing smoking-related cancers increases with duration of smoking. Therefore those users that start at younger ages and continue to smoke are at higher risk for tobacco-related disease and death. (11) National data show that 95 percent of adult smokers begin smoking before they turn 21. The ages of 18 to 21 are a critical period when many smokers move from experimental smoking to regular, daily use. (12) Young adults aged 18 to 24 are more than 2 times as likely to use smokeless products as compared to older adults aged 45 to 64. (13) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute of Medicine recommend comprehensive and sustained tobacco control programs and policies at the Federal, State, and local level in order to reduce youth initiation and the prevalence of tobacco use. (14) Regulating the retail environment, actively enforcing laws, and educating retailers are strategies that Federal, State, and local governments can take to restrict the availability of tobacco products to youth. (15) The recent report of the Institute of Medicine entitled, ``Public Health Implications of Raising the Minimum Age of Legal Access to Tobacco Products'', concluded that raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products nationwide will reduce tobacco initiation, particularly among adolescents aged 15 to 17, and will improve health across the lifespan and save lives. Specifically, the report said that raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products nationwide to age 21 would, over time, lead to a 12-percent decrease in smoking prevalence. (16) The Institute of Medicine report also predicts that raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products nationwide to age 21 would result in 223,000 fewer premature deaths, 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer, and 4,200,000 fewer years of life lost for those born between 2000 and 2019. In addition, the report concluded that raising the minimum legal age of sale would result in near immediate reductions in preterm birth, low birth weight, and sudden infant death syndrome. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION AND ENFORCEMENT. (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including any Federal regulation, it shall be unlawful to sell or distribute a tobacco product to anyone under the age of 21. (b) Enforcement.-- (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to enforce the prohibition under subsection (a) and shall take necessary action to enforce such prohibition, including, as appropriate-- (A) conducting undercover compliance checks, performing retailer inspections, initiating enforcement actions for noncompliance, and taking any other measures appropriate to help ensure nationwide compliance with such prohibition; and (B) establishing requirements that retailers check identification or use other methods to ensure compliance with subsection (a), or issuing guidance concerning the responsibility of retailers to ensure such compliance. (2) Enforcement authority.--In the case of a violation of subsection (a), the Secretary of Health and Human Services may apply the penalties under section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 333), as though such subsection (a) were a regulation promulgated under section 906(d)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 387f(d)(1)), notwithstanding paragraph (3)(A)(ii) of such section 906(d). (c) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``tobacco product'' has the meaning given such term in section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(rr)). SEC. 4. NON-PREEMPTION. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prevent a State or local governmental entity from establishing, enforcing, or maintaining a law with respect to sales of tobacco to individuals below a minimum age, provided that such State or local law is at least as restrictive as the Federal law.\n\nSummary:","completion":" Tobacco to 21 Act This bill prohibits the sale or distribution of tobacco products to individuals under the age of 21.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Birth Control Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: (1) Family planning is basic health care for women. Access to contraception helps women prevent unintended pregnancy and control the timing and spacing of planned births. (2) Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention included family planning in its published list of the Ten Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century, the United States still has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancies among industrialized nations. (3) Each year, 3,000,000 pregnancies, nearly half of all pregnancies, in the United States are unintended, and nearly half of unintended pregnancies end in abortion. (4) Women rely on prescription contraceptives for a range of medical purposes in addition to birth control, such as regulation of cycles and endometriosis. (5) The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency contraception to be safe and effective in preventing unintended pregnancy and has approved over-the-counter access to emergency contraception for individuals aged 17 and older. (6) If taken soon after unprotected sex or primary contraceptive failure, emergency contraception can significantly reduce a woman's chance of unintended pregnancy. (7) Emergency contraception works like other hormonal birth control by preventing pregnancy. It also does not harm or terminate an already-established pregnancy. (8) Access to legal contraception is a protected fundamental right in the United States and should not be impeded by one individual's personal beliefs. (9) Reports of pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions for contraceptives, including emergency contraceptives, have surfaced in States across the Nation, including Alabama, Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Since emergency contraception became available without a prescription for certain individuals, refusals to provide non-prescription emergency contraception have also been reported. SEC. 3.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Mississippi Valley National Historical Park Act of 1999''. (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as follows: Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. Sec. 2. Findings. Sec. 3. Mississippi Valley National Historical Park, Blytheville, Arkansas. Sec. 4. Transfer of jurisdiction, Eaker Air Force Base, for historical park. Sec. 5. Acquisition of Chickasawba Mound for inclusion in historical park. Sec. 6. Administration of historical park. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) The central and lower Mississippi Valley region contained the highest population levels and the most complex Native American societies north of Mexico before the arrival of European peoples in the 16th century. (2) In addition, the Mississippi Valley has also hosted Spanish, French, English, and ultimately American societies at different times in the last 450 years. (3) Blytheville, Arkansas, is centrally located in the Mississippi Valley region. (4) Former Eaker Air Force Base, which is located outside of Blytheville, Arkansas, in the central Mississippi Valley region, is the site of 14 archaeological sites associated with Native Americans. (5) Because of its value in illustrating and interpreting the heritage of the United States, the largest of these archaeological sites, was recognized by the National Park Service as a National Historic Landmark in 1996. (6) Another archaeological site outside of Blytheville, Arkansas, the Chickasawba Mound, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 because of its historic and archaeological resources. (7) These previous actions by the Department of the Interior recognize that these archaeological sites are likely to benefit, educate, and inspire present and future generations of Americans, but no unified heritage park for the central Mississippi Valley region exists within the National Park Service. (8) Blytheville, Arkansas, also possesses many other regionally and nationally significant natural, seismic, cultural, and recreational resources associated with the heritage of the central Mississippi Valley region. (9) The sites and resources associated with the heritage of the central Mississippi Valley region require recognition through the establishment of a national historical park for the central Mississippi Valley region as a unit of the National Park System. (10) As a result of the closing of Eaker Air Force Base in Blytheville, Arkansas, pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, Federal land and facilities are readily available for the establishment of a national historical park for the central Mississippi Valley region to protect the archaeological sites located on the former military installation, as well as to preserve, maintain, and interpret the natural, seismic, cultural, and recreational heritage of the central Mississippi Valley region for the benefit, education, and inspiration of present and future generations of Americans.

(b) Boundaries.--The historical park shall consist of approximately 570 acres, including the real property transferred to the National Park Service at former Eaker Air Force Base under section 4 and the parcel of real property containing the archaeological site known as the Chickasawba Mound and authorized for acquisition under section 5. The boundaries of the historical park shall also include all property authorized to be acquired for inclusion in the park by any law enacted after the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4.

(3) Selection.--The parcel to be transferred under this subsection shall be jointly selected by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Interior. (c) Use of Land.--The Secretary of the Interior shall use the real property transferred under this section as part of the historical park. (d) Legal Description.--The exact acreage and legal description of the real property to be transferred under this section shall be determined by a survey satisfactory to the Secretary of Defense. The cost of the survey shall be borne by the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 5. ACQUISITION OF CHICKASAWBA MOUND FOR INCLUSION IN HISTORICAL PARK. The Secretary of the Interior may acquire for inclusion in the historical park, by donation or exchange, the archaeological site known as the Chickasawba Mound, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

(a) Applicable Laws.--The Secretary of the Interior shall administer the historical park in accordance with this Act and the laws generally applicable to units of the National Park System, including the Act of August 25, 1916 (commonly known as the National Park Service Organic Act; 16 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), and the Act of August 21, 1935 (commonly known as the Historic Sites, Buildings, and Antiquities Act; 16 U.S.C. 461 et seq.). (b) Cooperative Agreements.-- (1) Authorized.--The Secretary of the Interior may consult and enter into cooperative agreements with interested entities and individuals to provide for the preservation, development, interpretation, and use of the historical park. (2) Conditions.--Any payment made by the Secretary pursuant to such a cooperative agreement shall be subject to an agreement that conversion, use, or disposal of the project assisted under the cooperative agreement for purposes contrary to the purposes of the historical park, as determined by the Secretary, shall result in a right of the United States to reimbursement of all funds made available to such project or the proportion of the increased value of the project attributable to such finds as determined at the time of such conversion, use, or disposal, whichever is greater.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. REVISION OF TITLE XII. Title XII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8501 et seq.) is amended to read as follows: ``SEC. 12001. FINDINGS. ``The Congress finds the following: ``(1) There are 52,700,000 students in 88,223 elementary and secondary schools across the United States. The current Federal expenditure for education infrastructure is $12,000,000. The Federal expenditure per enrolled student for education infrastructure is 23 cents. An appropriation of $22,000,000,000 would result in a Federal expenditure for education infrastructure of $417 per student per fiscal year. ``(2) The General Accounting Office in 1995 reported that the Nation's elementary and secondary schools need approximately $112,000,000,000 to repair or upgrade facilities. Increased enrollments and continued building decay has raised this need to an estimated $200,000,000,000. Local education agencies, particularly those in central cities or those with high minority populations, cannot obtain adequate financial resources to complete necessary repairs or construction. These local education agencies face an annual struggle to meet their operating budgets. ``(3) According to a 1991 survey conducted by the American Association of School Administrators, 74 percent of all public school buildings need to be replaced. Almost one-third of such buildings were built prior to World War II. ``(4) The majority of the schools in unsatisfactory condition are concentrated in central cities and serve large populations of poor or minority students. ``(5) In the large cities of America, numerous schools still have polluting coal burning furnaces. Decaying buildings threaten the health, safety, and learning opportunities of students. A growing body of research has linked student achievement and behavior to the physical building conditions and overcrowding. Asthma and other respiratory illnesses exist in above average rates in areas of coal burning pollution. ``(6) According to a study conducted by the General Accounting Office in 1995, most schools are unprepared in critical areas for the 21st century. Most schools do not fully use modern technology and lack access to the information superhighway. Schools in central cities and schools with minority populations above 50 percent are more likely to fall short of adequate technology elements and have a greater number of unsatisfactory environmental conditions than other schools. ``(7) School facilities such as libraries and science laboratories are inadequate in old buildings and have outdated equipment. Frequently, in overcrowded schools, these same facilities are utilized as classrooms for an expanding school population. ``(8) Overcrowded classrooms have a dire impact on learning. Students in overcrowded schools score lower on both mathematics and reading exams than do students in schools with adequate space. In addition, overcrowding in schools negatively affects both classroom activities and instructional techniques. Overcrowding also disrupts normal operating procedures, such as lunch periods beginning as early as 10 a.m. and extending into the afternoon; teachers being unable to use a single room for an entire day; too few lockers for students, and jammed hallways and restrooms which encourage disorder and rowdy behavior. ``(9) School modernization for information technology is an absolute necessity for education for a coming CyberCivilization. The General Accounting Office has reported that many schools are not using modern technology and many students do not have access to facilities that can support education into the 21st century. It is imperative that we now view computer literacy as basic as reading, writing, and arithmetic. ``(10) Both the national economy and national security require an investment in school construction. Students educated in modern, safe, and well-equipped schools will contribute to the continued strength of the American economy and will ensure that our Armed Forces are the best trained and best prepared in the world. The shortage of qualified information technology workers continues to escalate and presently many foreign workers are being recruited to staff jobs in America. Military manpower shortages of personnel capable of operating high tech equipment are already acute in the Navy and increasing in other branches of the Armed Forces. ``SEC. 12002. PURPOSE. The purpose of this title is to provide Federal funds to enable local educational agencies to finance the costs associated with the construction, repair, and modernization for information technology of school facilities within their jurisdictions. ``SEC. 12003. FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF GRANTS. ``(a) Authority and Conditions for Grants.-- ``(1) In general.--To assist in the construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization for information technology of elementary and secondary schools, the Secretary shall make grants of funds to State educational agencies for the construction, reconstruction, or renovation, or for modernization for information technology, of such schools. ``(2) Formula for allocation.--From the amount appropriated under section 12006 for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allocate to each State an amount that bears the same ratio to such appropriated amount as the number of school-age children in such State bears to the total number of school-age children in all the States. The Secretary shall determine the number of school-age children on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data available to the Secretary. ``(b) Conditions for Receipt of Grants.-- ``(1) Applications.--In order to receive a grant under this title, a State shall submit to the Secretary an application containing or accompanied by such information and assurances as the Secretary may require. Such applications shall specify the method by which the State educational agency will allocate funds to local educational agencies and the procedures by which projects will be selected for funding. Such applications shall contain assurances that such funds will only be provided if the State educational agency finds that such constructions will be undertaken in an economical manner, and that any such construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization is not or will not be of elaborate or extravagant design or materials. ``(2) Priorities.--In approving projects for funding under this title, the State educational agency shall consider-- ``(A) the threat the condition of the physical plant poses to the safety and well-being of students; ``(B) the demonstrated need for the construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization as based on the condition of the facility; ``(C) the age of the facility to be renovated or replaced; and ``(D) the needs related to preparation for modern technology. ``(c) Amount and Condition of Grants.--A grant to a local educational agency may be in an amount not exceeding the total cost of the facility construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization for information technology, as determined by the State educational agency. ``SEC. 12004. GENERAL PROVISIONS. ``The Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on any project assisted under this part-- ``(1) shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on the same type of work on similar construction in the immediate locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Act of March 31, 1931 (Davis-Bacon Act), as amended; and ``(2) shall be employed not more than 40 hours in any 1 week unless the employee receives wages for the employee's employment in excess of the hours specified in paragraph (1) at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which the employee is employed; but the Secretary may waive the application of this subsection in cases or classes or cases where laborers or mechanics, not otherwise employed at any time in the construction of such project, voluntarily donate their services without full compensation for the purpose of lowering the costs of construction and the Secretary determines that any amounts saved thereby are full credited to the educational institution undertaking the construction. ``SEC. 12005. DEFINITIONS. ``As used in this title: ``(1) School.--The term `school' means structures suitable for use as classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and related facilities, the primary purpose of which is the instruction of elementary and secondary school students. ``(2) State.--The term State includes the several States of the United States and the District of Columbia. ``SEC. 12006. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. ``There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this title, $22,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 and a sum no less than this amount for each of the 4 succeeding fiscal years.''.\n\nSummary:","completion":" Amends title XII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to make grants to State educational agencies for elementary and secondary school construction, reconstruction, or renovation, or for modernization of information technology for such schools.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``At-Home Infant Care Act of 2004''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) In the majority of American families, parents, whether married or single, must work to provide economic security for their families and, not the least, for the infants newly welcomed into the family. Fifty-five percent of women with children less than 1 year of age are part of the workforce, while 73 percent of women with children 1 year of age or older are in the workforce. (2) Research shows that the quality and nature of care- taking in the first months and years of life are critical to a newborn's subsequent brain development, social development, and well-being. Healthy early development depends on nurturing and dependable relationships. (3) Research also shows that there is an extreme shortage of quality, affordable child care for infants. Numerous studies document lack of infant care and, in particular, affordable care that meets basic health and safety standards, particularly in rural areas. The current number of licensed infant slots can only meet 18 percent of the potential need. The shortage is even more acute in rural areas, especially those with a high percentage of low-wage residents. (4) For the well-being of American children, and for the economic security of the families on which they depend, working parents should be able to provide this care themselves without undermining family economic stability.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Limitation on Assistance to the Palestinian Authority Act of 2006''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) In fiscal year 2005, the United States provided $275 million to the West Bank and Gaza, of which $50 million was provided directly to the Palestinian Authority. (2) On January 25, 2006, the militant group Hamas, an organization designated by the Department of State as a foreign terrorist organization, won parliamentary elections and control of the Palestinian government. (3) The inclusion of Hamas or any other foreign terrorist organization in a Palestinian government is an implicit endorsement of anti-American and anti-Israeli terrorist ideology. (4) On December 16, 2005, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed House Resolution 575, which asserts that ``terrorist organizations, such as Hamas, should not be permitted to participate in Palestinian elections until such organizations recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, cease incitement, condemn terrorism, and permanently disarm and dismantle their terrorist infrastructure''. (5) House Resolution 575 further asserts that ``the inclusion of Hamas, or any other terrorist group on the Department of State's list of foreign terrorist organizations, in the Palestinian Authority's government will inevitably raise serious questions for the United States about the commitment of the Palestinian Authority and its leadership to making peace with Israel and will potentially undermine the ability of the United States to have a constructive relationship with, or provide further assistance to, the Palestinian Authority''.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Within hours after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the Imperial Japanese forces launched an attack on the Philippines, cutting off vital lines of communication to United States and Filipino troops assigned to the United States Army Forces in the Far East under the command of General Douglas MacArthur. (2) On December 8th, 1941, the 200th Coast Artillery Regiment, successors to the New Mexico National Guardsmen who made up part of the famed ``Rough Riders'' of the Spanish- American War, were the ``first to fire''. (3) Despite being cut off from supply lines and reinforcements, the United States and Philippine Forces quickly executed a plan to delay the Japanese invasion and defend the Philippines against the Japanese invasion. (4) By April 1942, troops from the United States and the Philippines had bravely and staunchly fought off enemy attacks in Bataan for more than 4 months under strenuous conditions that resulted in widespread starvation and disease. (5) By maintaining their position and engaging the enemy for as long as they did, the troops at Bataan were able to redefine the momentum of the war, delaying the Japanese timetable to take control of the southeast Pacific for needed war materials. Because of the Bataan defenders' heroic actions, United States and Allied forces throughout the Pacific had time to regroup and prepare for the successful liberation of the Pacific and the Philippines. (6) On April 9, 1942, Major General Edward King, his troops suffering from starvation and a lack of supplies, surrendered the soldiers from the United States and the Philippines into enemy hands. (7) Over the next week, troops from the United States and the Philippines were taken prisoner and forced to march 65 miles without any food, water, or medical care in what came to be known as the ``Bataan Death March''. (8) During this forced march, thousands of soldiers died, either from starvation, lack of medical care, sheer exhaustion, or abuse by their captors. (9) Conditions at the prisoner of war camps were appalling, leading to increased disease and malnutrition among the prisoners. (10) The prisoners at Camp O'Donnell would die at a rate of nearly 400 per day because of its poor conditions. (11) On June 6, 1942, the prisoners from the United States were transferred to Camp Cabanatuan, north of Camp O'Donnell. (12) Nearly 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino Prisoners of War died at Camp O'Donnell, and survivors were gradually paroled from September through December 1942. (13) Between September of 1942 and December of 1944, American prisoners of war who survived the horrific death march were shipped north for forced labor aboard ``hell ships'' and succumbed in great numbers because of the abysmal conditions. Many of the ships were mistakenly targeted by allied Naval forces because the Japanese military convoys were not properly labeled as carrying prisoners of war. The sinking of the Arisan Maru alone, claimed nearly 1,800 American lives. (14) The prisoners who remained in the camps suffered from continued mistreatment, malnutrition, lack of medical care, and horrific conditions until they were liberated in 1945. (15) The veterans of Bataan represented the best of America and the Philippines. They hailed from diverse locales across both countries and represented a true diversity of Americans. (16) Over the subsequent decades, these prisoners formed support groups, were honored in local and State memorials, and told their story to all people of the United States. (17) The United States Navy has continued to honor their history and stories by naming 2 ships after the battle including 1 ship still in service, USS Bataan (LHD-5), in memory of their valor and honorable resistance against Imperial Japanese forces. (18) Many of the survivors of Bataan have now passed away, and those who remain continue to tell their story. (19) The people of the United States and the Philippines are forever indebted to these men for-- (A) the courage and tenacity they demonstrated during the first 4 months of World War II fighting against enemy soldiers; and (B) the perseverance they demonstrated during 3 years of capture, imprisonment, and atrocious conditions, while maintaining dignity, honor, patriotism, and loyalty. SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf of the Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design in honor of the troops from the United States and the Philippines who defended Bataan and were subsequently prisoners of war, collectively, in recognition of their personal sacrifice and service to their country during World War II. (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the award under subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary. (c) Smithsonian Institution.-- (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in honor of the defenders and prisoners of war at Bataan under subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given to the Smithsonian Institution, where it shall be displayed as appropriate and made available for research. (2) Sense of the congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal received under paragraph (1) available for display at other locations, particularly such locations as are associated with the prisoners of war at Bataan. SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS. (a) Striking of Duplicates.--Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may strike duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under section 2. (b) Selling of Duplicates.--The Secretary may sell such duplicates under subsection (a) at a price sufficient to cover the costs of such duplicates, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses. SEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS. Medals struck pursuant to this Act are National medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS; PROCEEDS OF SALE. (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund, an amount not to exceed $30,000 to pay for the cost of the medal authorized under section 2. (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of duplicate bronze medals under section 3 shall be deposited in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n\nSummary:","completion":" Authorizes the award of a single Congressional Gold Medal to collectively honor the troops from the United States and the Philippines who defended Bataan, Philippines, and were subsequently prisoners of war, in recognition of their personal sacrifice and service to their country during World War II.

{"prompt":"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Change Education Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) The evidence for human-induced climate change is overwhelming and undeniable. (2) Atmospheric carbon can be significantly reduced through conservation, by shifting to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal, and by increasing the efficiency of buildings, including domiciles, and transportation. (3) Providing clear information about climate change, in a variety of forms, can remove the fear and the sense of helplessness, and encourage individuals and communities to take action. (4) Implementation of measures that promote energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy will greatly reduce human impact on the environment. (5) Informing people of new technologies and programs as they become available will ensure maximum understanding and maximum effect of those measures. (6) More than 3,000,000 students graduate from high schools and colleges each year, armed with attitudes, skills, and knowledge about the climate that inform their actions. (7) The effect on the climate, positive or negative, of each of those 3,000,000 students lasts beyond a lifetime. (8) Those students need to be prepared to implement changes in professional and personal practices, to support and help develop new technology and policy, and to address the coming social and economic challenges and opportunities arising from a changing climate. (9) It has been demonstrated that the people of the United States overwhelmingly support teaching students about the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to climate change in all 50 States and more than 3,000 counties across the United States.
