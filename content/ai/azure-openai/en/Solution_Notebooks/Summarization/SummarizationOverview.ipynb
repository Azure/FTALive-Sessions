    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge bases in enterprises are very common in the industry today and can have extensive number of documents in different categories. Retrieving relevant content based on a user query is a challenging task.  Given a query we were able to retrieve information accurately at the document level using methods such as Page Rank developed and made highly accurate especially by Google,  after this point the user has to delve into the document and search for the relevant information.  With recent advances in Foundation Transformer Models such as the one developed by Open AI the challenge is alleviated by using “Semantic Search” methods by using encoding information such as “Embeddings” to find the relevant information and then to summarize the content to present to the user in a concise and succinct manner.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This Playbook will introduce the Use Case and End to End architecture briefly and for the most part will take you through the step-by-step process of using OpenAI's GPT-3 model to perform long text summarization, walking through using a what is referred to as “zero-shot”  examples, “few-shot” prompt engineering examples, and finetuning methods to change and improve the output summaries. There are different pros and cons to each approach such as performance, cost, and training time. \n",
    "\n",
    "This playbook aims to demonstrate how to use Azure OpenAI’s GPT-3 capabilities to adapt to your summarization case, and how to set up and evaluate summarization results. The methods and architecture are extremely customizable to your summarization use case and can be applied to many different datasets. \n",

    "## Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization is the process of creating summaries from large volumes of data while maintaining significant informational elements and content value. A few reasons why text summarization is essential across industries are:\n",
    "1. Shortens reading time\n",
    "2. Improves the effectiveness of searching for information among vast quantities of data\n",
    "3. Removes bias from human summarization techniques\n",
    "4. Increases bandwidth for humans to focus on more in-depth analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "The need for document summarization be applied to any subject matter (legal, financial, journalist, medical, academic, etc) that requires long document summarization. The   subject matter that this playbook is focusing on is journalistic - we will walk through news articles. As the subject gets more technical, we make a case for further fine-tuning of the GPT3-model rather than just using the few-shot or zero-shot example methods.  \n"

    "## End to End Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "An E2E architecture found in Images/EndToEndArchitecture.png captures the use case that we talked about the previous sections. The user passes their query to a knowledge base to filter the number of documents top most relevant docouments, narrows the scope of documents to tens from a couple of thousands. This cna be done using Azure Cognitive Search by creating a custom index for your knowledge base. Then once a document is selected, the document needs to be segmented and then each segment can be embedded using GPT-3 embedding models. This allows each text chunk to have its semantic meaning captured through an embedding. Then the user can send another query to search within the document and \"zone in\" on a particular text segment or segements based using similarities between the query and embeddings for each text chunk. Once a section is \"zoned-in\", the user can extract the relevant text and pass it to the GPT-3 Completion endpoint for summarization. \n",

    "This playbook will focus only on the Summarizer portion highlighted in the figure. There is another notebook covering the embeddings and zone-in process in the diagram, but is not included here."

    "## Summarizer\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will cover the end-to-end flow of using the GPT-3 models for summarization tasks. We will look on how to craft the prompts for zero shot and few shots examples, walk through fine tuning a model, and compare results from these different approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used by the Azure OpenAI service is a generative completion call which uses natural language instructions to identify the task being asked and skill required – aka Prompt Engineering. Using this approach, the first part of the prompt includes natural language instructions and/or examples of the specific task desired. The model then completes the task by predicting the most probable next text. This technique is known as \"in-context\" learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main approaches for in-context learning: Zero-shot, Few-shot and Fine tuning. These approaches vary based on the amount of task-specific data that is given to the model: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Zero-shot**: In this case, no examples are provided to the model and only the task request is provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Few-shot**: In this case, a user includes several examples in the call prompt that demonstrate the expected answer format and content. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-Tuning**: Fine Tuning lets you tailor models to your personal datasets. This customization step will let you get more out of the service by providing: \n",
    "-\tWith lots of data (at least 500 and above) traditional optimization techniques are used with Back Propagation to re-adjust the weights of the model – this enables higher quality results than mere zero-shot or few-shot. \n",
    "-\tA customized model improves the few-shot learning approach by training the model weights on your specific prompts and structure. This lets you achieve better results on a wider number of tasks without needing to provide examples in the prompt. The result is less text sent and fewer tokens \n"

    "\n",
    "GPT-3 models can perform many tasks. Therefore you must be explicit in describing what you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "The models try to guess what you want from the prompt. If you send the words \"Give me a list of cat breeds,\" the model wouldn't automatically assume that you're asking for a list of cat breeds. You could just as easily be asking the model to continue a conversation where the first words are \"Give me a list of cat breeds\" and the next ones are \"and I'll tell you which ones I like.\" If the model only assumed that you wanted a list of cats, it wouldn't be as good at content creation, classification, or other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three basic guidelines to creating prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Show and tell**. Make it clear what you want either through instructions, examples, or a combination of the two. If you want the model to rank a list of items in alphabetical order or to classify a paragraph by sentiment, show it that's what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Provide quality data**. If you're trying to build a classifier or get the model to follow a pattern, make sure that there are enough examples. Be sure to proofread your examples — the model is usually smart enough to see through basic spelling mistakes and give you a response, but it also might assume this is intentional and it can affect the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check your settings.** The temperature and top_p settings control how deterministic the model is in generating a response. If you're asking it for a response where there's only one right answer, then you'd want to set these lower. If you're looking for more diverse responses, then you might want to set them higher. The number one mistake people use with these settings is assuming that they're \"cleverness\" or \"creativity\" controls.\n",

It flows similar to a human like conversation, and stays succinct and to the point. Additionally, as we see above the different prompts impact the resulting summaries so it is importnat to play around which prompt provides the best results for your individual use case."

       "\"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Border Hospital Survival and Illegal Immigrant Care Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) Immigration is a Federal responsibility. (2) The Immigration and Naturalization Service does not take into custody all aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States. (3) Section 1867 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395dd) and State laws require that, if any individual (whether or not lawfully present in the United States) comes to a hospital and the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide either, within the staff and facilities available at the hospital, for such further medical examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition, or, if appropriate, for transfer of the individual to another medical facility. (4) The Southwest border region is ill-equipped to absorb the expense of providing health care to undocumented aliens because it ranks last in the country in terms of per capita income. (5) The Southwest border region has been designated as a health professional shortage area under section 332 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e). (6) The unreimbursed costs associated with caring for undocumented aliens are severely threatening the financial stability of health care providers in Arizona. SEC. 3. REIMBURSEMENT TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE RENDERED TO CERTAIN ALIENS. Section 322 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 249) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(d)(1) The Secretary shall establish and implement a 5-year pilot program under which funds made available under paragraph (6) are used to reimburse providers for items and services described in section 411(b)(1) of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1621(b)(1)) provided in Arizona to aliens described in paragraph (3), and to reimburse suppliers of emergency ambulance services furnished to such aliens for which the transportation originates in Arizona (where the use of other methods of transportation is contraindicated by the alien's condition), if payment may not be made to reimburse the provider or supplier under any Federal program or law other than this subsection (such as title XIX of the Social Security Act), any State or local program or law, any group or individual health plan, or any insurance policy. ``(2) As part of the pilot program, in a case in which an alien described in paragraph (3) arrived at a hospital in Arizona and the hospital provided for such medical examination and treatment of the alien as the hospital determined was required to stabilize an emergency medical condition (within the meaning of section 1867(e)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395dd(e)(1))), the Secretary shall use funds made available under paragraph (6) to reimburse the hospital for any transportation costs paid by the hospital to return the alien to the United States border, if-- ``(A) the hospital requested the Attorney General to take the alien into custody after such stabilization; ``(B) such request was denied within 24 hours after its receipt, or the Attorney General gave no response to it within such period; and ``(C) the hospital determined that discharging the alien without providing for such transportation might pose a threat to the health or safety of the alien (or, with respect to a pregnant alien, the health or safety of the alien or her unborn child). ``(3) An alien is described in this paragraph if the alien-- ``(A) is not lawfully present in the United States and not detained by any Federal, State, or local law enforcement authority; or ``(B) is paroled into the United States under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) for less than one year in order to receive treatment for an emergency medical condition. ``(4) During the period in which the pilot program is operating, the Secretary shall submit annual reports to the Congress on its operation. Each report shall contain at least the following information: ``(A) The number of aliens to whom assistance was rendered for which payment was made under this subsection during the previous year. ``(B) The nationality of such aliens. ``(C) The average cost per alien of such assistance. ``(D) The total annual amount paid to each provider or supplier of assistance. ``(E) The feasibility and estimated cost of expanding the pilot program to items and services provided anywhere in the Southwest border region of the United States. ``(5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize any reduction in the funds payable to any person under any Federal program or law other than this subsection (such as title XIX of the Social Security Act), any State or local program or law, any group or individual health plan, or any insurance policy. ``(6) To the extent provided in appropriations Acts, from amounts made available to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for enforcement and border affairs for each of the 5 fiscal years following the fiscal year in which the Border Hospital Survival and Illegal Immigrant Care Act is enacted, the Attorney General may transfer to the Health Resources and Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services such amounts as may be necessary to carry out this subsection, not to exceed $50,000,000 for each such year.''.\""

We continued to deliver a high-quality service to \\nclients, whilst prioritising the safety and wellbeing of our employees, advancing our strategy and keeping a close eye on operating costs.  \\n\\nFunds under management and administration (FUMA) grew by 8.5% to reach £54.7 billion at 31 December 2020, reflecting both strong \\ninvestment performance and growth. Underlying profit before tax increased by 4.3% to £92.5 million, delivering an underlying \\noperating margin of 25.3% that was consistent with the prior year despite lower investment markets. \\n\\nAs a consequence, the board is announcing a final 2020 dividend of 47 pence per share, which brings the total dividend to 72 pence per \\nshare, an increase of 2.9% over 2019. 2020 marks the 11th consecutive year in which we have increased our total annual dividend. \\n\\nWhilst we expect 2021 to remain volatile, our balance sheet is robust with a strong capital position. Our near-term focus is to execute \\nour growth strategy, to build our market share, to balance ongoing investment in the business, and to continue to apply strict cost \\ndiscipline. Rathbones will emerge stronger after the challenges of the pandemic begin to subside.”  \\n\\nFinancial highlights \\n\\n— Total FUMA reached £54.7 billion at 31 December 2020, up 8.5% from £50.4 billion at 31 December 2019 \\n\\n— £44.9 billion in the Investment Management business, up 4.4% (2019: £43.0 billion) \\n— £9.8 billion in the funds business, up 32.4% (2019: £7.4 billion) \\n\\n— Total net inflows across the group were £2.1 billion (2019: £0.6 billion), representing a growth rate of 4.2% (2019: 1.3%) \\n\\n— Gross organic inflows in Investment Management were consistent at £3.3 billion in 2020 compared to £3.3 billion in the prior year \\n— Acquired inflows of £0.6 billion in Investment Management largely reflect the transfer of assets from Barclays Wealth (£0.4 billion) \\n— Investment Management outflows for the year totalled £3.3 billion (2019: £3.9 billion) \\n— Net inflows in our funds business were £1.5 billion (2019: £0.9 billion) \\n\\n— Profit before tax for the twelve months to 31 December 2020 was £43.8 million (2019: £39.7 million). Basic earnings per share totalled \\n\\n49.6p (2019: 50.3p) \\n\\n— Operating income totalled £366.1 million, 5.2% ahead of the prior year (2019: £348.1 million) \\n\\n— Operating income in Investment Management totalled £320.6 million, an increase of 3.1% on the prior period (2019: £310.9 million) \\n— Operating income in our funds business totalled £45.4 million, an increase of 22.0% on the £37.2 million reported in 2019 \\n\\n— Underlying1 profit before tax totalled £92.5 million, an increase of 4.3% (2019: £88.7 million); underlying operating margin of 25.3% \\n\\n(2019: 25.5%) \\n\\n— Underlying1 earnings per share totalled 133.3p (2019: 132.8p) \\n\\n1.
