# Azure Machine Developers Experience Live event

In this session you will get a solid understanding of the overall on the concept of [Training models with Azure Machine Learning (AzureML) CLI, SDK, and REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-train-model?tabs=python) by walking through step-by-step examples, leading up to ML model lifecyle management leveraging Azure ML Python SDK V2 so we can help accelerate your AI journey in the cloud. We will review how we work with ML models in Azure ML Pythin SDK V2 and then demostrates how we leverage Azure ML Python SDK V2 to work with ML models in local environment or with ML Studio.
The content of this session is available in our [github repository](https://aka.ms/ftalive/azureml/ml-developers-experience).
