# Microsoft Identity Platform

## Overview

In this session you will learn about the different offerings available in the Microsoft Identity Platform to help you integrate your solutions with a modern cloud-scale identity platform. We will discuss **Azure AD** (for both single-tenant and multi-tenant apps), **Azure AD B2B** for guest user access and **Azure AD B2C** for Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM). We will discuss how they are similar, where they are different, and when to choose which.
