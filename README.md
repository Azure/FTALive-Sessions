| Application Modernization | Application Lift and Shift                                                                    | A "lift and shift" approach offers a quick migration path to the cloud. While this is a valid approach, it is also important to understand the trade-offs of migrating applications with minimal code changes, which can also introduce new complexities in infrastructure as well as increased costs in the short term. In this session, we will discuss the pros and cons of lift and shift, as well as recommended best practices for long-term successful applications in the cloud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The main focus will be the different options available at a high level - the concepts are widely shared between different services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

You will learn why it is important to apply a "shift-left" security strategy to your software development lifecycle. You will also learn where to apply which security in your CI/CD stages.<br /><br />Agenda: (1) How to shift your security focus left. (2) Steps in your development process where security can be built in. (3) Tools that can help you in improving your overall security.<br /><br />Audience: This session is most useful for application architects wanting to improve their overall security stance, as well as security officers wanting insights in how development processes can be secured from the initial conception of a project all the way to production. This session is also useful for developers wanting to build in security on their developer processes. Some knowledge on overall DevOps practices and automation is nice to have. |
