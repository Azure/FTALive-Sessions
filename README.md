# Folder Structure
You will notice that the layout of this repository is nested by Azure Solution area; this is to make finding information and storing easier for all parties.

However when updating your content you can search by the session title itself.
Additionally there is a series of shortlink names "aka.ms/ftalive-name" to ensure the githup folder appears on the https://aka.ms/ftalive customer website.
