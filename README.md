# Structure
You will notice that the layout of this repository is nested by Azure Solution area; this is to make finding information and storing easier for all parties.

However when updating your content you can search by the session title itself.
Additionally if you visit https://aka.ms/ftalive you will see a github icon link for each session that goes directly the folders here.
